include all categorizes micro small medium enter well necessity opportunity their consideration This phenomenon bundling entrepreneurship under the generalist label not exclusive observed other country However not always helpful from policy perspective the request the romania ecosystem stakeholder this report focus strengthening the policy program institution essential for promoting startup particularly involving technology digital Our analysis current policy mix demonstrates that policymakers not clearly distinguish between startup small medium enterprise thus the former remain despite their promise startup have many unique characteristic that distinguish them from other they are typically young highly innovative work with emerging technology nascent sector are often still trying establish business model There are fundamental difference between young startup attempting scale within new industry old with little growth ambition traditional sector even though they may the same size their core characteristic the resource which they draw will quite distinct For exam the high technical risk market risk many startup mean that risk such seed venture capital often appropriate but these will not interested established with growth ambition For these son startup are best considered specialist subset with particular need hence requiring policy program instrument See table below for comparison startup the cusp the new European programming period ha major opportunity it approach innovation entrepreneurship policy The Recovery Resilience Facility make some billion available loan grant support reform investment mitigate the economic TABLE Difference Between startup startup Aspiration business high growth Stable growing business earn Growth rate Faster More gradual Risk

larger share romania with doctorate master college degree were living state different than the one which they were born compared The difference amount percent between Additionally employment dominant motive among romania emigrant While ha the largest diaspora group the world this rapidly growing this possibly signal continuous concern about viable domestic employment opportunity Improvement entrepreneurship quality will also require more market opportunity for young small business both domestically abroad Barriers are preventing smaller from participating public procurement Public sector

the share selling online rise percent from percent However there remains vast unrealized potential le than cent received even percent their revenue via online sale Access for startup innovative remains challenge romania public sector mechanism are not tailored for small startup because they tend favor which may have the effect supporting incumbent over new entrant Moreover equity debt for research development remain below the average European Commission regulatory environment not optimized for entrepreneur startup This includes reform company formation process supporting distressed business improving the ease exiting investing into startup intellectual property protection This because policymakers not clearly distinguish between startup thus the former remain the existing regulatory policy mix Though entrepreneurship accorded reasonably high social status increasingly considered desirable career choice widely promoted the medium rank low indicator social capital Low social capital which ha been observed the European Commission also evident the ecosystem where stake holder reported network limited collaboration between stakeholder reinforcing the perception ecosystem fragmentation There also appears limited mentality entrepreneurship factor such risk appetite attitude towards entrepreneurship cultural mindset are shift though policymakers can ensure regulatory framework create enabling for startup entrepreneur start scale exit romania authority have introduced numerous policy instrument support innovation entrepreneurship These ought revisited with the view what extent they support the important issue term entry growth Part One analyzes the functionality existing policy instrument Part Two proposes additional policy recommendation address the existing policy mix with view increasing the high quality romania This report divided into two main part Part One examines instrument for Entrepreneurship contains analysis conducted the World Bank team culminates with recommendation improve the policy instrument Part Two present Policy Recommendation Notes for consideration operational element accompanying National Startup Ecosystem Strategy These could easily serve policymakers preparing future science technology innovation policy mix for the upcoming perspective Most the policy recommendation presented this report overlap with the Top Interventions the entrepreneurship ecosystem revealing alignment between the the demand for policy key ecosystem stakeholder Please see Annex Top Interventions the romania entrepreneurship Ecosystem for overview the Top Interventions the request the Regional Development Agency RDA two additional Policy Recommendations are included within through Startup The team recommends additional analysis inform Public recommendation that improves domestic market access for startup Part One Part One provides analysis policy instrument related entrepreneurship Innovation entrepreneurship are key driver growth productivity appropriate effective portfolio policy instrument relevant innovation entrepreneurship thus important driving economic growth creating job increasing living standard all which are important objective for continues advance it development This analysis leverage the two module the World Public Expenditure Review framework Part One composed two section analysis the current policy mix followed closer examination the functioning selected romania support program The section the mix examines the number expenditure the portfolio instrument with regard their objective type intervention The second section the ass the functionality governance selected romania support program This exercise ha it limitation because based incomplete program data limited interview secondary research undertaken between had make several assumption However follows closely the methodology the two stage the provides reason able indication both the relevance the policy mix program functionality This review did not cover instrument managed the European Investment Fund look detail the public funding research regulation technology transfer Thus Part One indicates area where additional data collection analysis would needed some the initial presented this report Nevertheless the analysis clearly several area where there scope for improvement Particularly make suggestion about reform the overall policy mix gap support well issue relating the design implementation overall governance instrument Key Findings Policy Mix Analysis The current portfolio policy highly concentrated resource are devoted few instrument much smaller instrument that are likely operating below their optimum scale Rationalizing scaling some these smaller instrument ought considered Most instrument have multiple objective For example some instrument combine productivity improvement objective with job creation objective This may suggest lack clarity the design Together with the large small instrument this suggests that few are likely target important objective some are likely ineffective There are gap objective recommend the development instrument that address management linkage with foreign market access mean achieving objective There are important gap support for entrepreneur startup There little specialization among instrument focused the private sector recommend the development more targeted instrument for startup individual well the intermediary organization that support such startup such incubator accelerator Some instrument may reinforce the role incumbent rather than encourage the growth innovative startup Most instrument have multiple intervention mechanism Different mechanism typically require different capability that are not complementary are rarely found one agency the same time mend that instrument that invoke multiple mechanism simultaneously reviewed Grants are the dominant intervention mechanism This may appropriate relatively underdeveloped entrepreneurship ecosystem However important remember that not every element the system can necessarily resolved through public money missing complementary aspect likely merit inclusion other kind instrument technical assistance Key Findings Functional Analysis Logic model are consistently weak The analysis found persistent weakness the logic model theory change instrument Developing articulating these model should enable better accounting input activity managing authority well improved targeting the instrument should also prompt idea for alternative instrument mechanism which would assist with rationalization the portfolio the development wider range mechanism budget were often This suggests that some expansion the more successful warranted evaluation need improved Evaluation currently stronger the Priority Axis level Improved evaluation the instrument level would also support rationalization the portfolio providing about which instrument should scaled which may need discontinued Administrative burden for many are still high There ha been effort managing body simplify the application process for support scheme reduce the bureaucracy for applicant However there are still indication that these process remain overly complex for applicant For example the fact that startup often need hire consultant advisor order apply for government support scheme indicator that the application process are overly complex Notably this may have the effect shifting support away from the earliest stage where most needed Bureaucratic burden for administrator are also Auditing instrument multiple time appears impose burden administrative team Bureaucratic friction likely increased the many instrument which have both separate intermediate body this may necessary condition some European funding but unlikely optimal Policy Recommendations Part Two present evidence policy recommendation separated into Notes for con input into National Startup Ecosystem Strategy These Notes will form the basis comprehensive package policy considered for implementation the romania Authorities While Part One present recommendation how improve current policy instrument mix for with special focus entrepreneurship Part Two present detail the kind policy program institution that would needed implement entrepreneurship ecosystem Many the policy presented this report overlap with the Top Interventions stakeholder the entrepreneurship ecosystem revealing consistency between the analytical the demand for policy key actor Upon consultation with the RDA two additional Policy Recommendations were included Notes through Startup The recommended approach draw upon wider review the literature the impact program support entrepreneurship the World Guide Innovation Policy

ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAMS CHAPTER OVERVIEW Comprehensive targeted policy can help stimulate entrepreneurship activity giving rise economic growth innovation job creation appropriately tailored portfolio policy instrument can encourage support the need given entrepreneurship ecosystem However poorly designed public instrument can displace inhibit private initiative innovation therefore important undertake periodic review the policy mix instrument it target this based the evolving need the entrepreneurship ecosystem Part One this report review instrument set support entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship support subset the broader set science technology innovation instrument The report follows the two module the World Public Expenditure Review methodology which aimed deter mining the quality government measure enhance the competitiveness the economy The full consists four main component They are portfolio mapping analysis the pol icy mix functional governance analysis effectiveness analysis The mod methodology several analogous exercise other European Union country beyond including Bulgaria Croatia Poland calibrated support authority throughout the perspective from planning through midterm program calibration impact evaluation When fully implemented the document the quality the intervention it ability enable the achievement the social economic cultural objective the nation The complete methodology with all it module illustrated Part One Analysis Existing Policy Mix Functionality includes the two module the the policy mapping policy mix analysis the functional governance analysis Due data limitation the conclusion within are preliminary yet indicative reality Some are substantial enough suggest potential policy improvement the area entrepreneurship research development However owing both limited data availability access public program manager most need more investigation fully ascertain the public policy what observed This consideration essential keep mind when interpreting the conclusion presented the end this portion the report Schematic the Stages World Bank Group Note Public Expenditure Review return investment science technology innovation entrepreneurship system performs poorly with opportunity for stronger public policy intervention Innovation key driver growth productivity the Introduction ha the weakest innovation system within the measured the European Innovation Scoreboard European Commission fact performance declined between relative the rest the innovation gap between other country widened follows that there room for improvement current policy the current trajectory the existing policy will close the innovation gap between other state DEFINITION The methodology distinguishes public policy their causal mechanism The focus public intervention The public policy based the causal mechanism that the intervention invokes produce the desired change the given area interest The instrument used here may differ from the nomenclature the romania government The used the regulation serve identify budget category that allow clear reference the order The used here based the need for the methodology associate budget category with effect society the economy Doing requires distinguishing instrument mean the causal mechanism which the desired result are expected occur Scholarships for postgraduate study abroad are one example order increase the population highly people with experience the state offer scholarship for postgraduate study abroad for national student The intervention subsidy the form scholarship this case allows student cover the high cost their study return the country receives the contribution these graduate when they return this case the mechanism for granting scholarship with the transfer resource involved instrument the policy Its implementation operates under the assumption that the country will not have the human resource the necessary quantity quality for it development unless intervenes with the scholarship that these student will return the country following their study CHAPTER POLICY MIX ANALYSIS PURPOSE This section cover the module the policy includes policy measure the area entrepreneurship well area innovation research development that are relevant for entrepreneurship This also allows policymakers understand entrepreneurship with the back drop the broader policy mix The budget analysis examines the relationship between expenditure objective the budget analysis the policy mix the focus the relation the expenditure each instrument the entire set that the with the pattern objective type intervention the case instrument aimed the private sector This analysis provides baseline for the interpretation further stage the policy METHOD The step compile list relevant instrument program involving public resource This list explicitly included regional national supranational source provided that the instrument least partially administered within the recipient themselves were within This long list included several program from the program sup ported the European Regional Development Fund intended increase competitiveness development improving information communication technology research innovation the Regional regional development program also supported the whose purpose the development infrastructure business environment the Capital the European Program for the Competitiveness Small Medium Enterprises the European Investment Bank This stage did not however include block funding university research organization for basic research nor did include all European Investment Fund funding Programs were then for relevance Having compiled the list program these were for their rel for entrepreneurship Only program with direct indirect relevance entrepreneurship were included Thus program that supported private sector were retained for instance because some these pro gram might digital startup However program relating only government were excluded Budget data extracted from available document estimate are likely incomplete This data based publicly available document concerning the relevant instrument well common data portal for many the program The data set not complete with some program having budget data therefore important note several caveat data might skewed external reporting factor Second where program had budget data estimate were made based past program other source which might inaccurate Third some program covered wide range activity including entrepreneurship such case the spending that relevant estimated based number reported the managing authority the program level Fourth some instrument targeted multiple analytical category such multiple size objective where this the case the total budget the instrument divided equally between the component Budgets were standardized over time The year implementation for instrument were standardized that the starting year the year the call that the end year the projected end year with fund running regulation unless otherwise stated The total budget the instrument then divided evenly the year from the start year until the projected end year The resulting average were multiplied the year passed since launch summed the case multiple call Although recognize that the real spending many program unlikely spread uniformly this way this aver age allows approximate comparison budget for program different length also recognize that the case instrument with multiple call there issue regarding overlapping call the methodology may lead incorrectly assume that greater proportion the budget spent year where call overlap Conclusions should considered carefully Given the various caveat about the data the process the level accuracy not Therefore analysis recommendation made within this report should treated with caution even though they tend mirror reality FINDINGS BUDGET The overall policy mix comprises some instrument with budget allocation over billion These relate the total budget allocation including European fund but excluding investment over the period under consideration The available data for source funding show that funding versus national funding received approximately ratio This includes national private sector fund that may leveraged public funding although this ratio should interpreted cautiously because there are missing value for several national instrument little over the policy mix ha entrepreneurship it core objective Thirteen the with related total budget allocation million have entrepreneurship explicit goal The remain the policy mix relate primarily innovation competitiveness These however may considered indirectly relevant entrepreneurship the development the broader ecosystem Standardizing budget over time provides estimated annual budget allocation million dis cussed above instrument vary duration one adjusts for this dividing each allocated budget over the year operation then summing these the average total annual budget amount million Alternatively one presumes that all spend will occur within the current funding period used for instrument then the annual expenditure may instead estimated around million This assumes that the budget each instrument distributed equally over their year operation also assumes that all instrument are operating concurrently which representative the most recent period under but not necessarily for earlier year Low absorption mean that this likely overestimation actual expenditure The fact that budget ha been allocated doe not mean that the amount were actually spent that the project consummated com knowledge that ha very low absorption the proportion budget that are actually spent time This occurs for several reason including lack suitable institutional capacity various level Data from October indicates that this absorption rate only percent for program administered the Human Capital Program percent for the Regional Operational low percent for the Competitiveness Operational what follows have typically referred the allocated budget because this better governmental priority However should noted that actual expenditure innovation likely much lower due the low absorption rate Distribution Estimated Public Budget Allocation Objective Million Note Policy mapping instrument which were with entrepreneurship were with innovation competitiveness with Primarily European Structural Investment Funds national fund Innovation Competitiveness instrument Innovation Competitiveness instrument Entrepreneurship instrument Other instrument There high concentration resource few instrument The graph below illustrates the cumulative annualized budget sorted from largest smallest instrument show concentration allocated resource few large instrument The three largest under the stat two under the Regional account for half the annualized budget the total annualized expenditure directed towards roughly quarter the total instrument analyzed this exercise corollary the high concentration resource few instrument that there are many small that may not have the scale necessary have impact even they are well designed Although not unusual such distribution budget similar pattern found other try important recognize that the individual instrument level the smaller instrument may represent disproportionately large administrative effort More than half the instrument this set involve le than million average annual expenditure OBJECTIVES term general objective the policy mix seems focused developing the business system instrument focus productivity improvement new venture skill job Knowledge creation however represented le than half the focusing other objective Furthermore there are entrepreneurship instrument focusing explicitly the role startup addressing environmental climate change objective Most instrument focus multiple general Thirty the instrument this set are focused two general objective simultaneously The focused social development human cap ital objective are the one that most often share their aim with another objective Fig other word there are very few instrument that focus solely these objective exclusively the other hand about half the instrument that focus productivity exclusively Cumulative Annualized Budget instrument World Bank Group instrument General Objective World Bank Group Note instrument can have multiple objective instrument the budget Cumulative Annual Budget also possible classify instrument according more objective which may considered the intermediary route which the general objective achieved For example instrument might have the ultimate goal improving productivity approach this via improving management adoption something else Note that although some the objective are likely more closely linked with some the general objective than others they are not necessarily subset the general objective The most common objective are technology transfer skill formation business environment improve entrepreneurship but many instrument have multiple objective Between instrument include one the top four their objective the other hand management linkage with foreign market access are addressed very few instrument fewer than for any one them Many instrument have multiple objective several instrument have four them Although skill formation technology transfer may seem the two most common objective for instrument none the instrument are strictly dedicated these objective The share the resource allocation around the total budget go two general productivity growth venture The other objective small fraction the annualized expenditure Thus the distribution expenditure general objective reveals differ picture from the one produced the instrument objective About many instrument are dedicated societal development human capital productivity growth venture however the budget dedicated the instrument focused societal development human capital much smaller than the budget dedicated the instrument that focus productivity instrument Intermediary Objective World Bank Group Note instrument may counted more than once General Objectives Supported instrument World Bank Group Two objective receive large share the budget expenditure innovation with adoption access Technology transfer improving the business environment entrepreneurship follow about half the size expenditure the larger one Other objective receive smaller budget allocation Thus the distribution expenditure show different pattern from the distribution the instrument objective instrument Objective Sole versus Mixed World Bank Group Annual Budget General Objective World Bank Group Note Where instrument have multiple objective the budget split evenly across them Annual Budget Objective World Bank Group Note Where instrument have multiple objective the budget split evenly across them TYPES INTERVENTIONS Grants including matching grant are the preferred method intervention the instrument are this category The type intervention represented each instrument important feature public policy the combination type inter the multiple causal mechanism that the strategy invokes obtain the sired result the distribution objective what public authority want achieve the dis type intervention indicates how they are acting See appendix for more complete these Several instrument use more than one intervention mechanism simultaneously some case the use multiple intervention mechanism may associated with the fact that several instrument are center that contain multiple type intervention within them However this not the case for all other instrument are not center but nevertheless have multiple intervention This pattern multiple intervention mechanism instrument consistent with that observed le developed innovation system For example the largest instrument invokes three intervention mechanism voucher tax incentive infrastructure These are not easy manage together given the different assumption each Vouchers are instrument purchase service performed another entity selected the Tax incentive apply the for their own performance Infrastructure supply side instrument for pub good research facility higher education institution for example This combination highly unusual other example the largest program the provides not only grant but also business service infra structure collaborative network education for this case because the purpose the instrument set incubator the funding set the activity are included objective This case le problematic but the report confuses the level which the intervention operates The only valid mechanism this case the grant Net working training for example are not carried out government agency could the case that the grant set incubator provided combination with train networking business service government agency that case the intervention would would have designed such The evidence doe not suggest this the case for this intervention Grants also dominate the budget The distribution resource again the dominant role grant with science technology park collaboration network voucher tax leading importance Estimated Annual Budget Type Intervention World Bank Group instrument Type Intervention World Bank Group TYPES BENEFICIARIES Half the instrument Universities research institute are next followed business cluster association This consistent with the prominence productivity key objective policy Firms are also the main recipient funding but individual researcher follow closely The budget emphasis individual researcher not the instrument This mean the three focused individual researcher have average larger budget than the focused Business consortium association still appear prominently budget expenditure but university research institute receive smaller proportion resource given the instrument should noted that there are other funding instrument for university that were not examined this because they did not relate entrepreneurship also very notable that business enablers including incubator appear have both relatively low instrument relatively small overall budget directed towards them individual entrepreneur have very little direct funding FIRM CHARACTERISTICS instrument focused primarily target micro small medium enterprise The policy that indicate among their that most the instrument are uniformly distributed across size Large are targeted fewer than half many instrument those targeting the other size The distribution disbursed fund project various might reveal that certain type received more support than others However information disbursed fund pattern supported project not available only possible determine the documented aim the instrument allocation yearly average budget follows the same pattern Both the the budget allocation show that many instrument target several size simultaneously fact

governance the integration interaction with other program institution regulation METHOD The methodology for the analysis based comprehensive analytical framework best The analytical framework developed the World Bank score support program along total variable related program design related implementation related program gov See Annex instrument Examined for the overview examined instrument See Annex Detailed Findings the Functional Analysis for more detailed from the Functional Analysis including the approach for the data The functionality each program scored scale for each variable where denotes international best practice score should not necessarily interpreted but functional aspect that satisfactory but ha room for improvement Summary Functional Analysis Indicators World Bank Group DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION GOVERNANCE The analysis aim reveal whether key element effective innovation policy have been met three key area Design Public intervention must designed through process covered the rule law consist with general national regional goal for research innovation They must properly address real problem avoiding the trap addressing false failure This can also help avoid capture public resource certain vested Once system failure policy should consider the full range alternative intervention design rather than simply copying existing pro gram design intervention should follow clear logic model that help depict the shared relationship causal linkage between program input activity output outcome logically connect them strategic objective Logic model should indicator for input activity output outcome that allow for program performance Implementation Processes for administering the program including application selection reporting should clear transparent knowledge management system should place allow for learning improvement the instrument during implementation Implementing agency must have adequate human resource organizational structure administer the program staff should have training opportunity incentive that are relevant program performance rather than generic public administration staff Internal external the instrument should take place critically evaluation result should used improve adapt the program Governance Coordination mechanism should place minimize overlap enhance between the instrument other program agency Implementing staff should also aware external law regulation that can inhibit the implementation the instrument should taking step adapt for optimal operation the instrument This analysis cover nine instrument supporting covering the period Together these nine instrument represent around billion the billion the total allocated funding around percent However many the remaining set instrument fall under the same operational program ministry will share some similar characteristic The key agency ministry interviewed which included the Ministry Funds Investments the Ministry Public Works Development Public Administration the Ministry Finance were responsible for the administration the bulk the instrument the policy mix instrument totaling billion the billion many case that other instrument were designed operated similar fashion those one under analysis Thus although the functional analysis only examined nine instrument there reason believe that this sample the wider policy mix Nevertheless the observation conclusion from this analysis should viewed indicative possible issue but not conclusive the small sample may not capture many potential area interest regarding that affect the functionality the overall set policy The analysis based interview Interviews were held with key staff from the instrument concerned each scored team composed minimum three interviewer order try minimize inter viewer bias occasion multiple interview were held for one instrument either because administration instrument split across organization because needed important note that the National Authorities were not the primary client this project agreed participate the request regional authority result the project did not have the internal motivation connect with the potential opportunity for learning continuous improvement Therefore the interview were not informative lacked the detailed narrative about organizational culture tacit knowledge that made available for the functional analysis other country Some information gleaned from report stakeholder rather than the program manager themselves However the perception outsider can not substitute for direct report from the manager themselves OVERVIEW FINDINGS score show some area that are ripe for improvement Some score are higher than others there variation within indicator when considering the average score comparison the max minimum score for each indicator across the set instrument included the analysis discus design implementation governance issue related variation Several the area show from regulation general regulation appear have had positive impact functionality including the program origin closure coordination mechanism However also noted area where unclear inadequate rule may have contributed low score particularly the use logic model the consideration alternative instrument suggest that would help romania authority differentiate more clearly between compliance functionality these are not the same instrument appeared demonstrate focus the former the expense the latter DESIGN Among the design indicator those related the use logic model accounting input activity the proper measurement outcome deserve special attention The area specif opportunity for improvement are the indicator with lower score The problem area have average score below the middle the range point indifference The high average score for program origin also noticeable The remaining indicator have average score slightly above better but with room for improvement The existence application logic model the proper cataloging input activity are two area concern The lower score these indicator reveal possible dis connect between the destination the expenditure the instrument the administrative cost incurred implement given that cataloging input tie relates directly the ability estimate such cost The quality the objective the the determination outcome impact are other area concern For example objective are often statement the need for the other word the case funding the objective instrument provide fund certain area because there little funding support that area This sort statement circular begs the question why the gov must support what outcome are expect from providing The program origin ha good general which explained the process required the opera the framework These process are highly formalized requiring documentation good rationale for inclusion instrument their funding scheme This avoids pitfall related arbitrary reason imitation undue However possible that this origin ha also affected deeper consider some other design feature more than once interviewee commented that design instrument had been determined heavily the European Commission rather than having been designed the romania authority itself following consideration various alternative The relatively high average score for inclusion system deserves further scrutiny The score for this mainly due the existence centralized data gathering reporting system which offer good infra structure for data information management when come However well known from other try that such centralized system are often tailored general government investment expenditure not include item that are tailored science technology innovation policy Average score for Design indicator World Bank Group Moreover the fact that both objective outcome are not good raise the question how the operates relation the instrument implementation Most the response received from the interview revealed that program manager did not distinguish the objective input activity output outcome project from the policy instrument appeared that often weaker the instrument level than the program level Priority Axis level Supported project not automatically aggregate successful gov intervention the outcome these instrument may not good enough the even each individual project within ha good result Therefore the design the system may not what the instrument really need therefore recommend that this aspect functionality examined closer detail the future IMPLEMENTATION Among the implementation indicator eligibility selection criterion budget incentive associated with performance are concern The implementation indicator related eligibility budget staff incentive process monitoring have lower average score score these indicator fall below the scale shown below The application process the side the relation submitting proposal expecting decision timely manner There some variety across instrument but the division labor process application with different role given different entity technical assessment for exam some repetition process limit timely response The budget indicator average score relatively low This the that many instrument have executing not having good understanding the demand for the focus the design the solicitation There were problem with both undershoot overshoot suggesting that instrument budget are not designed commensurate with instrument goal romania instrument are not hiring specialized human resource connecting performance ass with program goal monitoring for continuous improvement Most the reporting management indicated degree satisfaction with the structure availability human resource However the score may overestimate the actual situation because common hear during interview that the public service system operated under general rule the manager did not think much the relation between those the policy under study There consensus developed nation the analytical liter management public support for innovation that specialized human resource are necessary with entrepreneurship approach public management this vein the performance assessment staff not related the content the instrument This disconnect between performance assessment program goal occurs other area the general established process public service Similarly the process public management were not monitored for continuous improvement which it lower average score Implementation capacity requires further examination suspect that implementing capacity lacking neighboring country for which functional analysis were also conducted Reasons suspect that this may constraint include the fact that some instrument did not seem have enough skilled staff nor many opportunity for improving their own staff This reinforced evidence from other World bank project such the Innovation project well from ecosystem stakeholder Regrettably were unable examine this detail our research did not allow direct observation the working condition nor the romania Government the ultimate client However suggest that warrant closer attention Average score for Implementation indicator World Bank Group Note monitoring evaluation Many instrument were structured way that likely increase administrative cost notable that many instrument were structured way that involved both intermediate body working coordination This generally reported working satisfactorily with clearly responsibility However from management theory perspective well from practical experience similar situation other try seems unavoidable that this structure will introduce some additional friction cost For example case adjustment are needed during instrument implementation impediment arise due application reg rule this arrangement might call for consultation lengthy negotiation Situations such these were found all other country the region where functional analysis conducted Bulgaria Croatia Poland follow this analysis may necessary ass the proper operation this division labor understand whether the functionality any instrument affected GOVERNANCE The analysis found relatively good internal external coordination mechanism coordination with program within the agency with other agency shown below This partly because program within the have some coordination built However some case those could utilized further provide more strategic perspective the related program The functional analysis also found several entrepreneurship program being constrained European State Aid rule This primarily due the State Aid rule not being the support government intervention However these rule are not easy change manager were typically aware these rule their constraint but can not change mitigate their effect EVIDENCE FROM VARIATION There variation the score across indicator for this set instrument indicating for learning within Variation refers how well policy instrument scored against the scenario according global practice Higher score are coded green average score are coded yellow lower score are coded red The combined radar graph illustrate variance public instrument This chart show the maximum minimum score for each indicator addition the average score for each indicator Some indicator have relatively high score least one instrument even when the average quite low Conversely several indicator have the lowest possible score well This indicates that there potential for internal learning from the example better some the instrument Comparing score variability reveals system wide strength need for system wide improvement opportunity for learning from within Another view the variation score across program presented below which plot the average score indicator the horizontal axis the standard the vertical axis indicator that fall the upper two quadrant those with high standard deviation are area within the set policy with high potential for internal learning there are program these area with both high score good low score poor Variables that fall the upper left quad rant show great variation score but lower average learning opportunity may the greatest these area Variables the bottom left quadrant are those with both low score low standard deviation the need for improvement with few any example good this set policy Indicators the bottom right quadrant are those with high score low standard deviation indicating area strength Average Score for Governance Indicators World Bank Group Program relationship Jurisdictions internal Institutions relationship Jurisdictions seriousness Score best Category Functional Analysis Results score Category across the Set World Bank Group Average Score Standard Deviation Across All instrument World Bank Group Note monitoring evaluation Average score Standard deviation There are several indicator that seem need systematic improvement These indicator the lower left quadrant are design indicator associated with the use logic model input activity the instrument rather than supported project the matter setting instrument objective out come impact There also implementation indicator this group namely the budget that seems also systemic issue There are opportunity for learning including from internal capability The indicator the upper left quadrant where there are opportunity for learning including from internal capability include the consideration alternative instrument for the same objective the design side the eligibility criterion application information process monitoring the implementation side the effect rule from other jurisdiction Mixed indicator strength There are many indicator the upper right quadrant that have average above the midpoint but also rather high variance indicating that there are case with poorer those area well Finally there are few indicator that show good systematically shown the lower right quadrant These are the origin instrument their closure These two indicator from requirement that establish clear rule for these area design implementation Accounting for product the instrument selection criterion design ability learn systematically from experience with the instrument are other area better practice There some more variation the design that this quadrant small margin which related how well adjusted the centralized digital platform used for the need instrument See Annex Detailed Findings the Functional Analysis for more detailed from the Functional Analysis CHAPTER CONCLUSIONS The analysis above lead various conclusion about the policy mix function the instrument that using promote entrepreneurship The conclusion that may drawn that the concentration spending few instrument leaf many smaller instrument that may Within the complete collection instrument the national level the spending highly concentrated few instrument The largest instrument amount about half the yearly average budget while three the instrument account for half the total average yearly budget This high concentration mean that the remainder composed many instrument with small budget that are probably not scale have impact given that some the administration cost are likely Second the issue with the small scale many instrument compounded the fact that many them aim for several objective simultaneously Along with the high concentration the budget few instrument many instrument attempt achieve diversity objective both general objective objective there overlap between them The combination relatively large instrument with small budget several objective suggests that there may lack clarity the design instrument focus the intervention Most instrument already have relatively small scale the problem compounded the lack specialized focus because more resource are required attend multiple objective Having many intervention with small budget complex purpose raise important question about the potential effectiveness the policy mix Third most instrument assume that money the only barrier achieving change the innovation This assumption can inferred from the fact that most instrument use grant matching grant the mechanism intervention The dominance subsidy not unusual present many try However must kept mind that grant assume that the only problem that need resolution from the public intervention perspective lack money that all other factor contributing innovation productivity competitiveness are available reachable money made available This almost certainly false highly unlikely that this the true condition the system any other nascent innovation system Moreover grant can sometimes have negative The potential negative effect can include market dis for example disadvantaging other business that not receive grant thereby distorting investment other economic activity grant dependency for example creating organization that can not compete without grant subsidy rely continued public support lobbying for example increasing the incentive for lobby the government instead engaging productive activity Given the stage development ecosystem suggest that such effect are not concern this time Nevertheless important review the effectiveness grant agent change For example recent work adoption suggests that managerial the lack knowledge skill within the often greater barrier adoption than the access the material technology itself grant solely for technology are likely have limited impact Many instrument use multiple intervention mechanism that are unlikely all their Numerous instrument invoke multiple causal mechanism the system addition the observation about the small scale great majority instrument the diversity their objective very for them effective all these dimension Given the expected complexity multiple type intervention the administrative cost these instrument very likely exceed their budget reduce their chance impact Different mechanism typically require capability that are not are rarely found one agency the same time Therefore instrument that have multiple form intervention may create challenge for administration should reviewed addition the diversity objective type intervention many instrument also indicate multiple type All the comment the multiplicity intervention mechanism are applicable here The best for managing public instrument suggest specialization term even within the same class This another reason recommend rationalization instrument The lack specialization among instrument focused the private sector may further challenge their There little specialization among instrument focused the private sector Many them simultaneously target several size life cycle stage However different size stage the life cycle face very different challenge have different need Experience indicates that each these business activity requires special skill serve them For example the policy support small startup with ambition potentially working emerging technology may very different from the policy needed support general very for uniform set intervention effectively address all these sue simultaneously Small instrument with such ambitious spectrum care requirement are highly unlike have such capability worth considering these instrument address better need targeting their intervention addition where targeting exists this may sometimes counterproductive the creation new high growth venture For example several instrument are targeted mature regardless their size than for the very early stage starting this may potentially reinforce the role incumbent rather than encouraging the growth innovative startup addition several instrument are available only that are already however experience from other country suggests that many startup that are high growth ultimately very may undergo considerable period during which they are focused growth many instrument target established technology high tech readiness level that mature supportive innovation system need provide support for technology across the spectrum technology readiness from the market Very few instrument address management linkage with foreign market access Academic research indicated that these play important role technology adoption exporting respectively but these area receive little attention Moreover although skill formation technology transfer seem the two most common objective for instrument none the instrument examined this study were strictly dedicated these objective Business enablers individual entrepreneur have little direct funding many ecosystem business including accelerator incubator play important role However such organization appear have both relatively low instrument relatively small overall budget directed towards them Individual entrepreneur opposed also have very little direct funding There are consistent weakness the logic model instrument The functional analysis the instrument showed that logic model were generally weak were the associated input objective outcome incentive Weaknesses the logic model instrument well mediocre the program may possibly linked with the origin some instrument some case the starting point for the development instrument appears not have been the internal market failure the subsequent develop logic model but rather desire follow the direction the the Priority Axis objective However important fully understand the rationale logic the guidance translate this into logic model for each instrument clearer logic model will then support numerous other aspect each development such more objective outcome better accounting input improved targeting consideration alternative instrument budget were often This includes both undershoot overshoot This issue likely related the problem having many intervention with small budget This again suggests that some expansion the more successful program may warranted Greater evaluation the instrument level needed often weaker the instrument level than the program level Priority Axis level There appeared good process for evaluating the overall impact the portfolio instrument also relatively good process for tracking evaluating individual project that are supported instrument However evaluation comparison the instrument themselves seems le clear Improving this will allow better decision about how rationalize the policy mix The administrative structure several instrument appears Many instrument were structured with This seems very likely introduce some additional friction cost Although this may necessary condition for some European fund important pay close attention the interface between organization Improved process monitoring may help ass this friction determine whether improving worsening over time general the dual role rule regulation perceived well neighbor that also receive structural fund the positive side origination policy rule for closure engagement with stakeholder are constructive element following guidance set the along the ax the country the other hand some area compliance with the rule substituted for better functionality because more technically sophisticated logic model indicator useful for guiding implementation generally are not developed beyond minimum compliance requirement The project did not have information similarity difference with nationally funded instrument carry out comparison Implementation capacity requires further examination There were suggestion from the research supported both ecosystem stakeholder other World Bank research that implementation capacity might constraint CHAPTER RECOMMENDATIONS IMPROVE POLICY MIX FUNCTIONALITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAMS The following present recommendation improve the functionality the existing policy mix with indicative refers activity that can accomplished within month year medium term refers activity that can accomplished within year Many these activity are due the programming period The timing this exercise coincides with review development new operational programming Lessons from this analysis can applied the future policy mix especially when come improving program management which impact how pro gram are designed implemented evaluated Rationalize the overall portfolio instrument reduce the small instrument that are likely ineffective due their scale Improve evaluation enable better comparison effectiveness hence inform ongoing decision about which instrument scale with attention smaller pilot instrument that may hold promise Such evaluation should look both effectiveness following module the methodology Clarify the objective that the rationale market failure trying address consider instrument that are more focused Although multipurpose instrument can effective rationalization may push towards fewer instrument that are more general scope the current portfolio multipurpose instrument likely have diluted impact may also make evaluation comparison more Ensure that the comprehensive set instrument there are specialized one designed for company the early stage technology readiness market readiness for company with aspiration for scale There need more support targeted towards startup individual entrepreneur This includes addressing management linkage with foreign market access This also includes separate dedicated instrument for skill formation technology transfer rather than these being joint objective along side others instrument should have explicit logic model hypothesized chain cause effect leading the desired outcome Further development such model linked with clearer for each instrument should enable better accounting input improved targeting the instrument well prompting idea for alternative instrument Further support business enablers including accelerator incubator most ecosystem these have important role play although such organization currently have relatively small overall budget directed towards them Consider wider range mechanism besides grant tailored appropriately type stage Grants are useful mechanism for the earliest stage entrepreneur including startup with riskier business model who often rely For other type loan guarantee tax incentive reform public procurement may effective grant some circumstance while le effect market reducing the risk term Continue reduce the administrative burden applicant Many instrument showed good sign having been otherwise reformed make easier for applicant However the fact that many applicant still rely consultant advisor indicates that there room for further improvement medium term aware the administrative burden staff apparent from interview that the burden audit other internal administration considerable cost the management many instrument Particularly where instrument are this will reduce their impact There may opportunity increase staff motivation term Formalize learning make better use available data Although there are clearly process for the system improvement instrument these could further developed particular there may value using the program database analyze instrument further understand how make adjustment This will further enhanced when combined with logic model that have clear view input process output

should developed with consideration the various recommendation Part One for example they should have objective low administrative burden for applicant low bureaucratic burden for clear logic for the intervention robust evaluation This likely also require expansion the institutional capacity distribute such funding addition the grant should coordination with the startup investment fund see recommendation above startup because previously noted grant equity investment may displace each other degree Because cost for grant tax relief will depend both the exact design the instrument the qualifying the uptake recommend that new instrument are pilot for limited period order gauge demand with budget allocated for comprehensive the scheme ENCOURAGING CONSORTIA FOR COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH Many country encourage collaborative research between research organization using collaborative research grant which are restricted collaborative partnership consortium Such collaboration are known encourage the exchange both explicit knowledge tacit knowledge with university collaboration being associated with innovative product Mun Larger research consortium may also particular helpful reducing coordination failure stimulating research other search low that for any one capture for it own competitive meaning that there reduced incentive for any one invest it production even the sector whole suggest that collaboration formation consortium formation should encouraged through the creation new collaborative research grant scheme explicitly requiring the involvement least one university partner least one private sector ideally The scheme could initial targeted towards solving societal challenge such climate change sustainability for which open call for proposal are invited Responding consortium partnership should led private sector order ensure focus commercial application suggest that partner should still have their cost funded percent that private sector partner may potentially receive subsidy their eligible cost depending the size the nature the project with the action above this likely also require expansion institutional capacity order administer the scheme ESTABLISHING KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER SECONDMENTS recommend that technology both explicit tacit further through the public funding knowledge transfer secondment Such scheme would subsidize the secondment member academic staff into for duration with the purpose encouraging knowledge transfer could potentially also operate reverse that subsidizing the movement industry researcher into university other research institution Secondments would but tailored the need the For example secondment under the edge Transfer Secondments scheme funded the United Engineering Physical Sciences Research Council may last between week year Proposed secondment should appraised panel including senior academic determine the quality feasibility INNOVATION FOSTER KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR the proposed project the likely business impact that may result from knowledge transfer The scheme could potentially managed the regional level Establishment the scheme will need address regulatory issue within university that may inhibit the mobility researcher INNOVATION VOUCHERS The recommendation above proposes scheme encourage Universities other research organ make available their research equipment infrastructure complement this pro pose scheme targeted startup other subsidize the cost research relating the use these facility This would take the form which would use public fund pay for portion cost research organization suggest that the val the voucher should relatively small with the application process for voucher being relative encourage their adoption for example the voucher could pay for facility use accompanying academic expertise suggest that proportion matched fund should requested from using the voucher order prevent abuse IMPLEMENTATION BODY The Ministry Research

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS PROGRAM ORIGIN The program origin indicator refers the formal pro through which instrument created The origin policy instrument must embedded process covered the rule law consistent with the general goal for which intend intervention The the problem being addressed the mean address must grounded actual evidence through systematic rigorous appraisal the issue the option reach the goal set address The score for this indicator are close best for this small set romania instrument See noted earlier most these instrument are funded the operational developed part the formal operational program process The downside this that occasion the external origin the program appears have other design feature Best the program continuation another program must adapted the current circumstance this improvement should based reasonable diagnosis evaluation the previous version the program Distribution Program Origin score World Bank Group Note score indicates best practice CONTENTS Program Portfolio Program Alternative Logic Main Selection Expected Outcomes Monitoring Evaluation Eligibility Criteria Application Selection Program Project Program Roles Staff Process Monitoring Evaluation Program Coordination Institutional Interaction Jurisdictions Interaction Jurisdictions Frequency Score Programs should explicitly linked strategic objective relevant the policy area question Programs can not constitute end themselves PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION The program indicator refers the pres diagnostics the particular market system failure that instrument intended dress The should detailed program documentation report provide analysis sensible estimation the size intensity the failure the impacted population score are le except for two instrument The diagnosis market system failure can improved the evidence for when mentioned could more one the with both average standard deviation the distribution below Several instrument can improve this issue The rationale for some instrument may not ground known systemic failure Some interviewee reported that the primary reason that instrument exist because the direction the rather than having themselves particular systemic failure Best Diagnostic that cover all the aspect the market system failure with evidence rationale for the need the intervention PORTFOLIO RELATIONSHIP The portfolio relationship indicator analyzes how program operates relation all other related rel both the national the European level The scoring this indicator includes potential overlap with the rest the policy mix coherent science technology innovation policy mix characterized dynamic complementary policy portfolio For example policy portfolio that support innovation company may have instrument that target company differ stage development with complementary company evolve capability size market presence Several instrument receive good practice score See The fact that the instrument are proposed within the the consideration their relevance the portfolio explains the good observed There are some instrument whose role the policy mix may Best Instrument design should include diagnostic analysis potential overlap with the rest the relevant program Distribution Program score World Bank Group Distribution Portfolio Relationship score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program objective indicator focus the goal that connect the instrument desired change such productivity growth market competitiveness knowledge These objective should achievable with concrete target Several instrument score below large due lack measurable objective the system level See Many instrument specify term project achievement rather than the overall effect the instrument the innovation system economy Some instrument spec objective term activity product pro rather than change the romania innovation system Several instrument also have mixed clear objective Best Objectives should clear measurable with concrete target Objectives should explicitly tied the system level change expected from the intervention ALTERNATIVE INSTRUMENT The alternative instrument indicator closely tied program the sense that evaluates whether approach were considered that can tackle the failure that instrument intended address Cost between instrument design should considered Where approach based international example are copied the design should adapted with the local context capacity national body Many instrument did not consider alternative model intervention for the stated objective The score for the consideration alternative instrument show considerable variability with average below Best program this indicator should have included coherent consideration different way for government intervention considering both national international program should able present the selection for the particular approach selected Distribution Program Objectives score World Bank Group Distribution Alternative Instrument score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score LOGIC MODEL The logic model indicator measure whether program have explicit logic model that connects the input output expected outcome the program with clear measurable indicator The logic model should well articulated the expected result should feasible Logic model should updated regularly program evolve over time Most instrument lack logic model See romania instrument consistently score worst the logic model indicator The logic articulated the level which required the European Commission also sometimes present the level individual project but not the actual intervention level This tie into the weakness instrument objective setting that are discussed below Best The highest score this indicator given instrument with full explicit logic model with high quality component explicit logic model doe not exist least implicit one doe The logic model used updated regularly INPUTS The input indicator measure whether program put are explicitly consistent with log model They should cover all resource needed implement the program including administrative operational cost Costs should monitored through out the implementation phase There only one instrument that ha above score input See Cataloging that exists incomplete focused only obvious resource little value compute cost the instrument level Best instrument this indicator one where all input including administrative cost have been clearly budgeted inside the logic model Inputs include all most the resource needed achieve the objective Also known logical framework theory change Distribution Inputs score World Bank Group Distribution Logic Model score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score ACTIVITIES The activity indicator measure whether all activity needed achieve the project objective have been cataloged are consistent with the logic model Activities should consistent with input output that all activity have purpose help reach the desired output There are two issue with activity One that many activity needed implement instrument are not considered the design planned advance The second issue that many instrument activity are confused with those are expected car out project The score for activity have larger variability See Best instrument with full explicit catalog all necessary activity for achieving the desired objective Activities are consistent with input output that all activity have purpose help reach the desired output The indicator measure whether all program output product have been explicitly They should consistent with all activity outcome order for the desired result achieved All output should measurable The overall score for product output are bit higher because most the indicator that are actually are product indicator See Their connection with outcome impact are not always well articulated Best instrument this indicator should have explicit complete prod related it logic Their relation outcome impact should explicitly stated activity are measurable MAIN BENEFICIARIES The main indicator focus whether the targeted the project design are con with the overall logic the instrument Beyond that they should also such way that can maximize the program Criteria for targeting quantitative measure should provided transparent manner are well but poorly targeted The selected instrument score around the mean above this indicator see all case are well but maybe missing either clarity their optimal targeting What generally missing tailoring the Distribution Activities score World Bank Group Distribution score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score needed that go beyond the generic sector size for example targeting startup intensive within the much larger pool The instrument this indicator have explicitly tailored their order achieve maximum result Best The selection should explicit coherent with the objective There should clear strategy for reaching the target group effectively SELECTION CRITERIA The selection criterion indicator refers whether selection criterion are consistent with both the objective the logic model instrument The design the selection criterion should such that will lead the maximum potential impact the targeted population The criterion should transparent simple easy understand instrument include information about selection criterion their design but the information need more detailed The score this tor are also See The instrument included the design least some spec what would have amounted good cation submission potential The one that score higher included more detailed criterion use later the assessment proposal Best The selection criterion with the highest score are those that are clear coherent They should lead reaching the population with greater impact The criterion should transparent simple easy understand AUDIENCES The audience indicator refers whether all program stakeholder can provide input into the instrument design instrumentation process There should formal mechanism place for stakeholder provide input into instrument design instrument should account for stake holder their role for the success the instrument Several score this indicator are the higher end showing that there are clear mechanism for stake holder consultation for many instrument See The one with lower score can use the instrument learn how prove their own procedure Distribution Main score World Bank Group Frequency Score Distribution Selection Criteria score World Bank Group Distribution Audiences score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score Best The instrument this indicator should account for audience their role the success the instrument EXPECTED OUTCOMES IMPACTS The expected outcome impact indicator refers whether outcome impact the program level are well connected desired change the system level They should also connected meas result assessment indicator Impact indicator should integrated the broader policy context country regional level Criteria should included for tracking the evolution outcome that allow for end program participation becomes clear that pro gram objective will not met opposed closure the end contract other extrinsic son not related result Many instrument lack measurable coherent impact indicator The overall score the selected instrument for expected outcome pact the second lowest for any indicator observed the functional analysis with average see The main problem arises from the lack measurable coherent impact indicator issue that the absence logic model lead lack connection between output outcome Best The expected outcome impact should explicit coherent observable measurable They should integrated fully with other policy inside outside the sector They should used performance measure Criteria are included for tracking the evolution outcome that allow for ending program participation becomes clear that program objective will not met opposed closure the end con tract other extrinsic reason not related result MONITORING EVALUATION DESIGN The monitoring evaluation design tor check whether there integrated embedded the design phase the instrument See The indicator chosen should high quality outcome impact Data collection method must realistic when external data used adjustment should made guarantee that the system would meet the need the instrument for the instrument relies external system adjustment the system must made the specif need aim the instrument avoid distorting the instrument logic accommodate external bureau requirement that not favor it functionality centralized system for tracking instrument place but it connection with Distribution score World Bank Group Distribution Design score World Bank Group Note monitoring evaluation Frequency Score Frequency Score process hard gauge All but one the instrument had above score These score were due mostly the centralized system that used for capturing all information for the instrument the pro they support The exact adaptation this system process for individual instrument gauge The higher score this indicator seems somewhat contradictory with the lower score objective that would building towards This score may overestimate the quality the sign the instrument level Best system that well connected with the program itself the quality key performance indicator for the instrument relies external system adjustment accommodation the system must made the need aim the Practitioners should avoid distorting the program logic accommodate external bureaucratic require that not favor it functionality indicator are outcome impact are not confused with indicator activity output Realistic method data collection have been considered for the measurement indicator LEARNING The learning indicator refers formal learning pro used for systematic improvement Learning process should used improve instrument design implementation procedure with systematic formal documentation the change being made Learning happening but not documented systematically formally See The score this indicator are the mid range slightly above There evidence learning adjustment from experience certain level documentation what learned There fully implemented knowledge management system though Best The instrument this indicator should apply the learning process the design the with systematic formal documentation used for improvement SOLICITATIONS The solicitation indicator refers the process for launching call for proposal whether they are consistent with the logic model Adjustments subsequent call for proposal should made with full cation aligned with the program objective Where call should published regularly have consistent predictable calendar the score for solicitation show high with some instrument showing good process for managing solicitation See Some the instrument could learn from Distribution Learning score World Bank Group Distribution Solicitations score Frequency Score Frequency Score World Bank Group the one However the connection between the ongoing budget execution issue the process may not have been clearly captured this indicator overestimating the average performance score Best The instrument are those where adjustment the call proposal are made with full aligned with the program objective Where appropriate call are published regularly have consistent predictable calendar ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA APPLICATION INFORMATION The eligibility criterion application Information indicator focus the eligibility criterion set reach the target population They should clear transparent all needed information should publicly available Selection information should collected analyzed including list applicant score awarded submit ted proposal other pertinent information related the submission selection process This information should made available applicant much general privacy regulation allow The dissemination eligibility selection consistent with the target population should appropriate lower score eligibility criterion information burdensome process The score for eligibility criterion application information one the lowest the area but show great variability see This mean see the distribution that several instrument have above score The lower score burdensome process that may require that applicant seek help such external consultancy agent sat the application requirement which imposes cost Best instrument with transparent selection process coherent with the target group instrument where the gathered information used improve adapt future selection criterion The candidate selected the amount money assigned them are known the public The administrative burden doe not lead need for additional resource submit application APPLICATION SELECTION PROCESS The application selection process indicator refers the mechanism for project selection used the implementing body which should agile responsive The committee responsible for award decision should composed relevant pendent expert appointed manner The mechanism for appealing award should accessible clear The average score this indicator from the mid range higher Several instrument had agile trans parent professional selection process See Several were the having some weakness the timeliness the selection process which vulnerable the effect appeal that changed the entire ranking application Distribution Eligibility Criteria Application Information World Bank Group Distribution Selection Processes score Frequency Score Frequency Score World Bank Group Best The best scoring instrument should have transparent agile responsive selection process Clear appeal resolution channel should place The award decision should fully the committee should set with the best regarding expertise interest PROGRAM DATABASE The program database information indicator refers the presence database system that track par project followup output other data relevant the program The system should used make adjustment the solicitation themselves increase responsiveness concern con tribute the general improvement management design the program should usable other program across the portfolio instrument mostly rely the centralized data system but not clear how well the system tailored the need each instrument whether the information the central database used it full extent See The program database indicator ha high average score but also high variability some unevenness the con with which information about the progress project either available used the instrument manager They mostly rely the centralized data which contains all project information report The degree which tailored the need each instrument not clear all case addition not clear whether the information from the program database used it full extent how make adjustment the instrument the solicitation Best The best scoring instrument should have information follow system place the data gathered should used order improve the performance the program The system used make adjustment the call themselves increase responsiveness concern contribute the general improvement program management design also other program PROJECT CLOSURES The project closure indicator focus the pres completion closing report The information obtained from can used for learning improving the impact the program score perfectly this indicator This perfect score see the clear regulation the termination project that are not meeting requirement their contract Best Closure criterion reporting should fully spec with high quality report result Distribution Program Database score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score Distribution Program Closure score World Bank Group BUDGET The budget resource indicator refers whether resource are appropriate for the program There should accountability the executing the program subcontracting entity this indicator ha low average score below the See instrument have had problem executing their budget timely fashion estimating correctly the demand for the particular focus the intervention Best The best scoring instrument have adequate resource with proper control execution mechanism place Budgets are estimated accurately for the potential demand for the intervention Program execution subcontracting entity are subject accountability standard PROGRAM MANAGEMENT The program management organization quality indicator look whether the organizational structure place are appropriate for administering the instrument The organizational structure should ensure external internal pressure the implementation the program should reviewed for adequacy given changing requirement with new policy instrument using division labor based authority implementing body may impose cost The management organization indicator ha bimodal distribution with two pro gram having perfect score the rest below See The higher score are due the involvement institution such the European Economic Area Norway Grants Program that carry out the implementation the instrument The rest are housed the ministry under regular public vice regime required the some use division labor involving implementing body that are not always aligned with need the instrument Although interviewee generally reported that this labor usually seems clear that this structure imposes some cost the overall process Best The organizational structure doe not have too many level that make for information the The organizational structure ensures minimization external internal pressure the implementation the program The organizational structure reviewed for functional adequacy given changing requirement with new pol instrument done using organizational effectiveness indicator Distribution Budget score Distribution Organization Quality score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score World Bank Group ROLES AUTONOMY The role autonomy indicator evaluated the autonomy that had introduce change whether clear role were place regard program implementation The implementing body should have the capacity introduce change capable resolving responding cant change the political economic environment exhibit mixed performance this tor This indicator also show bimodal distribution part due the same reason given before higher score for the involvement foreign but also due possibly different internal arrangement running collection instrument see Some are run better than others this the perception program manager Best The instrument should maintain clear role eliminate stress operate legit Mechanisms for managing change resolution should place STAFF TRAINING The training indicator evaluates the level training experience the implementing This includes assessing whether the staff adequate implement the program romania instrument scored from the bottom the top This indicator ha enormous variability with average score exactly the middle See The heterogeneity the perception for skill enhancement the adequacy the staff skill may due local condition with the ministry Some these issue are gauge with videoconferencing interview that not low for direct observation the work condition Some instrument did not seem have enough skilled staff nor many opportunity for improving their own staff Others thought they were Best The instrument this indicator have staff with exceptional experience educational background There are formal training opportunity incentive for advancement Distribution score World Bank Group Distribution score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score INCENTIVES The incentive indicator refers the presence clear explicit criterion for assessing performance Awards punishment should linked clear criterion related the duty the performance the instrument The average score the incentive for performance their relation the instrument outcome low separation the performance evaluation from the performance the instrument they manage See Staff performance fol low standard hierarchical procedure with evaluation down the chain command the direct supervisor However several staff commented that performance management stick Best instrument are managed staff that are being evaluated based criterion The management ha clear mechanism for rewarding good punishing bad performance tied the successful achieve program goal PROCESS MONITORING The process monitoring indicator check for the pres audit monitoring system with clear indicator for monitoring program implementation This system should applied periodically report should submitted presented higher tie Monitoring should aim for effective oversight with out becoming oppressive Except for the two instrument with higher score most are the below See The latter group instrument are subject the standard audit procedure national level Simultaneous audit seem problematic That say some case the lower score were due the perceived too much monitoring rather than too little Best Instrument subject robust administrative process monitoring with quality measurement indicator The process should appear periodically inform timely decision from management Distribution Incentives score World Bank Group Distribution Process Monitoring score World Bank Group Frequency Score Frequency Score MONITORING EVALUATION IMPLEMENTATION implementation refers the presence formal system that operates continuously used modify program generate impact evaluation The information should collected all tor level the latter should improved with time There must impact assessment well for learning adapting the program Programs should revised based implementation lesson The implementation ha high variability average score above the See This partly due the instrument managed foreign agency that ha perfect score The rest the score also seem high when compared peer try using similar infrastructure More emphasis put the existence the centralized digital infra structure than for continuous improvement This score probably overvalued Best The best performing instrument should have for program that operates con used modify program gen impact evaluation Information collected for indicator all level activity product etc Indicators are adapted improved with time Programs have been revised based lesson PROGRAM COORDINATION The program coordination indicator refers program acknowledges the existing portfolio program ha established good coordination communication with other program case when overlap occur they should resolved pro gram are combined coordinated Explicit criterion should exist for the overall effective related program The romania agency manage collection within the have builtin mechanism coordination among them result the average score relatively high above the See There not much clarity about the strategic this coordination mechanism Best The instrument are those that acknowledge the existing program have established good coordination communication case when overlap occur they are resolved the program are combined coordinated Explicit criterion exist for the overall effectiveness related program Distribution Implementation score World Bank Group Note monitoring evaluation Distribution Program Coordination score Frequency Score Frequency Score World Bank Group INSTITUTIONAL COORDINATION The institutional coordination indicator refers coordination mechanism with other pub private institution Evidence joint work with other institution should place the coordination institution prod the similar mechanism among body that are required the See The question how this coordination result improvement design for future cycle into consideration synergy tie remains unclear Best The best performing instrument are those that have established formal coordination mechanism with evidence collaborative work design Joined coherent strategic management should present There need evidence showing that work joint design process take place with other institution INTERACTION JURISDICTIONS AWARENESS The internal interaction jurisdiction rule regulation indicator refers the implementing edge law regulatory constraint Programs should adapted based jurisdictional limitation program staff should capable taking action positive mitigate negative factor For the most part program manager are aware jurisdiction rule that the potential for the instrument they manage See regulation are especially problem work around Best The best scoring instrument are the one where the implementing body fully aware acknowledges the jurisdiction interaction The best scoring instrument are the one where the implementing body ha taken action adapt the program based the jurisdiction rule regulation for optimal performance Distribution Institutions Coordination score World Bank Group Distribution Interaction Jurisdictions Awareness
