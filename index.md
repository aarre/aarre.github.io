I do various kinds of editing. What they have in common is an effort to ensure
that the authors' messages come across clearly in the final product.

In **developmental editing**, I help a team write a document that clearly
conveys key messages, has a compelling storyline, and backs its claims with
cogent arguments and evidence. The process is usually iterative and often
begins with brainstorming about key messages and a storyline, then proceeds
through an annotated outline, and results in a first draft that is often
quickly written and quite good.

**Structural editing** is usually not necessary if the process begins with
developmental editing. It has the same purpose: to arrive at a document that clearly
conveys key messages, has a compelling storyline, and backs its claims with
cogent arguments and evidence. However, it begins after the document has been
drafted. Often by this point, the draft has many problems, and the team members
are committed to decisions that may have been mistakes. As such, structural
editing is often more expensive and time-consuming than
developmental editing would have been.

**Line editing** involves paying special attention to the structure of sentences
and paragraphs. At this stage, I am looking not so much for "errors" of the
sort that will be caught in copyediting but for opportunities to sharpen the
language in sentences and shape paragraphs so that they convey key messages,
tell a story, make valid arguments, and present compelling evidence in
support of findings.

**Copyediting** is what most people think editors do--dotting the i's and 
crossing the t's.

The purpose of **proofreading** is to ensure that the final document is as
error-free as possible. I compare the final draft of the document (typically
in Microsoft Word) with the final proofs from a design or typesetting firm
(typically in a PDF created by InDesign). You would be surprised how many
errors can get introduced (or revealed) in the design and typesetting
process: I typically find hundreds of errors in a 100-page document.
