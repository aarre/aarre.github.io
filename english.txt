they compare the difference amount percent between and employment dominant motive among emigrant while have the fifth large group the and this rapidly this possibly signal continuous concern about viable domestic employment opportunity improvement entrepreneurship quality will also require more market opportunity for young and small both domestically and abroad prevent small firm from participate public procurement public sector can create important market for many startup and play role stimulate innovation while recent reform have improve current public procurement process and platform still perceive difficult access for startup and other small firm according the most recent data available smes bid percent public procurement contract but award only percent them regarding

platform have accelerate during the pandemic saw the share firm sell rise percent from percent there remain vast unrealized potential less than percent firm receive even percent their revenue via sale access finance for startup and innovative firm remain challenge public sector mechanism not tailor for small firm and startup because they tend favor which may have the effect support incumbent over new entrant equity and debt for research and development remain below the average commission regulatory environment not optimize for entrepreneur and this include reform company formation support distressed improve the ease exit invest into and intellectual property protection this because not clearly distinguish between startup and smes and thus the former remain the exist regulatory environment and policy mix though entrepreneurship accord reasonably high social increasingly consider desirable career and widely promote the rank low indicator social capital low social which have observe the commission also evident the ecosystem where stakeholder report network and limited collaboration and connectedness between reinforce the perception ecosystem fragmentation there also appear limited give back mentality intangible entrepreneurial such risk attitude towards and cultural difficult though can ensure regulatory framework create environment for startup and entrepreneur scale and exit authority have introduce numerous policy instrument support innovation and entrepreneurship these ought revisit with the view confirm what extent they support the important issue identify term entry and growth specifically firm part one analyze the functionality exist policy instrument part two propose additional policy recommendation address deficiency the exist policy mix with view increase the number high quality and firm this report divide into two main part part one examine for entrepreneurship and contain analysis conduct the world bank team culminate with recommendation improve the functionality the policy instrument part two present policy recommendation for consideration operational element accompany national startup ecosystem strategy these could easily serve prepare future and innovation policy mix for the upcoming perspective most the policy recommendation present this report overlap with the top identify the entrepreneurial reveal significant alignment between the analytical finding and the demand for policy key ecosystem stakeholder please see annex top the entrepreneurial ecosystem for overview the top the request the regional development agency two additional policy include scale through export and startup the team recommend additional analysis inform transform public procurement recommendation that improve domestic market access for startup part one part one provide analysis policy instrument relate entrepreneurship innovation and entrepreneurship key driver growth and productivity appropriate and effective portfolio policy instrument relevant innovation and entrepreneurship thus important drive economic create and increase live all which important objective for continue advance development this analysis leverage the first two module the world bank public expenditure review per framework and part one compose two section analysis the current policy mix follow close examination the select support program the first section the policy mix analysis examine the number and expenditure the portfolio instrument with regard their type and the second section the functional analysis assess the functionality and governance select support program this exercise have limitation because base incomplete program limited number interview and secondary research between and and have make several assumption follow closely the methodology the first two stage the per and provide reasonable indication both the relevance the policy mix and program functionality this review not cover instrument manage the investment fund look detail the public regulation technology transfer part one indicate area where additional data collection and analysis would need confirm some the initial finding present this report the analysis clearly identify several area where there scope for improvement make suggestion about reform the overall policy mix and gap well issue relate the and overall governance instrument key policy mix analysis the current portfolio policy highly concentrated significant resource devote few and much small instrument that likely operate below their optimum scale scale some these small instrument ought consider most instrument have multiple objective for some instrument combine productivity improvement objective with job creation this may suggest lack clarity the design instrument together with the large number small this suggest that few likely target important and some likely ineffective there gap objective recommend the development instrument that address management with foreign and market mean achieve objective there important gap support for entrepreneur and startup there little specialization among instrument focus the private sector recommend the development more targeted instrument for and individual well the intermediary organization that support such such incubator and accelerator some entrepreneurship instrument may reinforce the role incumbent rather than encourage the growth innovative startup most instrument have multiple intervention mechanism different mechanism typically require different capability that not complementary and rarely find one agency office the same time recommend that instrument that invoke multiple mechanism simultaneously review the dominant intervention mechanism this may appropriate relatively innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem important remember that not every element the ecosystem can necessarily resolve through public money miss complementary aspect likely merit inclusion other kind financial instrument and technical assistance key functional analysis logic model consistently weak the analysis find persistent weakness the logic model theory change instrument and articulate these model should enable good accounting input and activity manage authority mas well improve the instrument should also prompt idea for alternative instrument and which would assist with rationalization the portfolio and the development range mechanism budget often this suggest that some expansion the more successful warrant evaluation need improve evaluation currently strong the priority axis level evaluation the instrument level would also support rationalization the portfolio provide information about which instrument should scale and which may need discontinue administrative burden for many beneficiary still high there have significant effort manage body simplify the application process for support scheme and reduce the bureaucracy for applicant there still indication that these process remain overly complex for applicant for the fact that startup and smes often need hire consultant and advisor order apply for government support scheme indicator that the application process overly complex this may have the effect shift support away from the early stage where most bureaucratic burden for administrator also significant instrument multiple time appear impose significant burden administrative team bureaucratic friction likely increase the structure many which have both and separate intermediate body this may necessary condition some but unlikely optimal policy part two present evidence and policy recommendation separate into for consideration input into national startup ecosystem strategy these will form the basis comprehensive package policy

budget each instrument distribute equally over their year operation also assume that all instrument operate which representative the most recent period under investigation but not necessarily for early year low absorption mean that this likely overestimation actual the fact that budget have allocate not mean that the amount actually spend that the project consummate common knowledge that have very low absorption the proportion budget that actually spend time this occur for several include lack suitable institutional capacity various level data from indicate that this absorption rate only percent for program administer the human capital program percent for the regional operational and low percent for the competitiveness operational what have typically refer the allocate budget because

this section cover the second stage the per policy aim assess the functionality and governance select support thus provide recommendation for improve the and governance the country portfolio the analysis assess the rather than the support instrument the quality process involve create and implement each include the human and governance the instrument integration and interaction with other and regulation method the methodology for the analysis base comprehensive analytical framework international best practice the analytical develop the world score support program along total variable related program relate and related program governance figure see annex for the overview instrument see annex detailed the functional analysis for more detailed finding from the functional include the

satisfactory but have room for improvement figure summary functional analysis design origin relationship with portfolio choice instrument logic model selection criterion and impact evaluation design source world bank group implementation learning eligibility criterion application and selection process information management project closure and budget management and organizational quality and autonomy staff and train process monitor evaluation implementation governance relationship between instrument relationship between institution relationship with other policy and adjustment relationship with other policy limitation and the analysis aim reveal whether key element effective innovation policy have meet three key area design public intervention must design through process cover the rule law and consistent with general national regional goal for research and innovation they must properly justify and address real avoid the trap address false failure this justification can also help avoid capture public resource certain beneficiary once system failure policy maker should consider the full range alternative intervention design rather than simply copy exist program intervention should follow logic model that help depict the share relationship and causal linkage between program and outcome and logically connect them strategic objective logic model should define indicator for and that allow for program performance implementation for administer the include and should clear and and knowledge management system should place allow for systematic learning and improvement the instrument during implementation agency must have adequate human resource and organizational structure administer the and staff should have training opportunity and incentive that relevant program performance rather than generic public administration staff internal and external the instrument should take evaluation result should use improve and adapt the program governance mechanism should place minimize overlap and enhance between the instrument and other program and agency staff should also aware external law and regulation that can inhibit the implementation the instrument and should take step adapt for optimal operation the instrument this analysis cover nine instrument support cover the period these nine instrument represent around billion the billion the total allocate around percent many the remain set instrument fall under the same operational program and and will share some similar characteristic the key agency and ministry interview which include the ministry funds and the ministry public development and public administration and the ministry finance responsible for the administration the bulk the instrument the policy mix instrument total billion the billion and many case confirm that other instrument design and operate similar fashion those one under analysis although the functional analysis only examine nine there reason believe that this sample reflect the policy mix the observation and conclusion from this analysis should view indicative possible issue but not necessarily the small sample may not capture many potential area interest regarding practice that affect the functionality the overall set policy the analysis base interview hold with key staff from the instrument each score team compose minimum three order try minimize interviewer bias multiple interview hold for one either because administration instrument split across because clarification need important note that the national not the primary client this project and agree participate the request regional authority the project not have the internal motivation connect with the project potential opportunity for learn and continuous improvement the interview not informative and lack the detailed narrative about organizational culture and tacit knowledge that make available for the functional analysis other country some information glean from report stakeholder rather than the program manager themselves the perception outsider cannot substitute for direct report from the manager themselves overview score show some area that ripe for improvement some score high than there significant variation within indicator when consider the average score comparison the maximum and minimum score for each indicator across the set instrument include the analysis discuss and issue relate variation several the area show influence from regulation regulation appear have have positive impact include the program and mechanism also note area where unclear inadequate rule may have contribute low particularly the use logic model and the consideration alternative instrument suggest that would help authority differentiate more clearly between compliance and functionality these not the and several instrument appear demonstrate focus the former the expense the latter design among the design those relate the use logic accounting input and and the proper identification and measurement outcome deserve special attention the area specific opportunity for improvement reflect the indicator with low score figure the problem area have average score below the middle the range point indifference the high average score for program origin also noticeable the remain indicator have average score slightly above reflect good practice but with room for improvement the existence and application logic model and the proper input and activity two area concern the figure average for design indicator low score these indicator reveal possible program origin connect between the destination the expenditure the instrument and the administrative cost incur implement give that input and portfolio relationship tie relate directly the ability estimate such cost output the quality the definition objective the and the determination outcome and impact other area concern for objective category selection criterion main program program objective often statement the need for the other the case fund alternative instrument the objective instrument provide ing certain area because there little outcome support that area this sort statement logic model circular and beg the question why the must support and what outcome score best from provide source world bank group the program origin have good practice which explain the process require the operational the framework these process highly require documentation and good rationale for inclusion instrument their scheme this pitfall relate arbitrary undue influence possible that this origin have also affect deep consideration some other design feature more than interviewee comment that design instrument have determine heavily influence the commission rather than have design the authority itself follow consideration various alternative the relatively high average score for inclusion system deserve far scrutiny the score for this indicator mainly due the existence data gathering and which offer good infrastructure for data and information management when come well know from other country that such system often tailor general government investment and expenditure and not include specific item that tailor technology and innovation policy the fact that both objective and outcome not good raise the question how the system operate relation the instrument implementation most the response receive from the interview reveal that program manager not distinguish the and outcome project from the policy and appear that often weak the instrument level than the program level priority axis level project not automatically aggregate successful government and the outcome these instrument may not good enough influence the even each individual project within have good result the design the system may not what the instrument really need therefore recommend that this aspect functionality examine close detail the future implementation among the implementation eligibility and selection and incentive associate with staff performance concern the implementation indicator relate staff performance and process have low average score these indicator fall below the midrange the scale show figure below the application process reflect the side the beneficiary relation submit proposal and expect decision timely manner there some variety across but the division labor average for implementation ing application with different role give different indicator entity financial and technical for project closure and some repetition verification process limit program timely the budget indicator average score relatively low this reflect the difficulty that many instrument have execute and not have good understanding the demand for the specific focus the design the category learning program solicitation there problem with both undershoot staff and training and suggest that instrument budget process monitor not design commensurate with instrument goal eligibility criteria instrument not hire specialized budget human connect performance ass with program for continuous score best improvement most the management source world bank group and staff indicate degree satisfaction with the note and evaluation structure and availability human resource the score may overestimate the actual situation because common hear during interview that the public service system operate under general and the manager not think much the relation between those and the specific the policy under study there consensus nation and the analytical literature management public support for r&d and innovation that specialized human resource necessary with flexible entrepreneurial approach public management this the performance assessment staff not relate the content the instrument this disconnect between performance assessment and program goal occur other area and the general establish process public service the process public management not monitor for continuous which reflect low average score implementation capacity require further examination suspect that implement capacity lack neighbor country for which functional analysis also conduct suspect that this may constraint include the fact that some instrument not seem have enough skilled staff nor many opportunity for improve their own staff this reinforce evidence from other world bank project such the supporting innovation project well from ecosystem stakeholder unable examine this detail our research not allow direct observation the work nor the government the ultimate client suggest that warrant closer attention many instrument structure way that likely increase administrative cost notable that many instrument structure way that involve both and intermediate body work this generally report work with clearly define responsibility from management theory well from practical experience similar situation other seem unavoidable that this structure will introduce some additional friction and cost for case adjustment need during instrument implementation impediment arise due application regulation this arrangement might call for consultation and lengthy negotiation such these find all other country the region where functional analysis conduct and follow this analysis may necessary assess the proper operation this division labor understand whether the functionality any instrument affected governance the analysis find relatively good internal and external mechanism with program within the agency and with other agency show figure below this partly because program within the have some mechanism build some case those mechanism could utilize far provide more strategic figure average score for governance perspective the related program the functional analysis also find several relationship entrepreneurship program constrain state aid rule this primarily due the state aid rule not the category internal relationship support government intervention seriousness these rule not easy and manager score best typically aware these rule and their constraint but cannot change mitigate their effect source world bank group evidence from variation there significant variation the score across indicator for this set indicate opportunity for learn within variation how well policy instrument score against the accord global practice higher score cod average score cod and low score cod red the combine radar graph figure illustrate variance public instrument this chart show the maximum and minimum score for each indicator addition the average score for each indicator some indicator have relatively high score least one even when the average quite low several indicator have the low possible score well this indicate that there potential for internal learning from the example good practice some the instrument score and variability system wide need for system wide and opportunity for learn from within another view the variation score across program present figure which plot the average score per indicator the horizontal axis and the standard deviation the vertical axis indicator that fall the upper two quadrant those with high standard deviation area within

consideration alternative instrument for the same objective the design the eligibility criterion and application information and process the implementation and the effect rule from other jurisdiction mixed indicator and strength there many indicator the upper right quadrant that have average above the but also rather high indicate that there case with practice those area well there few indicator that show good practice show the low right quadrant these the origin instrument and their closure practice these two indicator benefit from requirement that establish clear rule for these area design and implementation accounting for product the identification beneficiary and selection criterion and ability learn systematically from experience with the instrument other area good practice there some more variation the design that this quadrant small which relate how well adjust the digital platform use for the need specific instrument see annex detailed the functional analysis for more detailed finding from the functional analysis chapter the analysis above lead various conclusion about the policy mix and function the instrument that use promote entrepreneurship the first conclusion that may draw that the concentration spending few instrument leave many small instrument that may ineffective within the complete collection instrument the national level the policy mix spending highly concentrate few instrument the large instrument amount about half the yearly average while three the instrument account for half the total average yearly budget this high concentration mean that the remainder compose many instrument with small budget that probably not sufficient scale have give that some the administration cost likely fix the issue with the small scale many instrument compound the fact that many them aim for several objective simultaneously along with the high concentration the budget few many instrument attempt achieve diversity objective both general objective and specific objective and there overlap between them the combination relatively large number instrument with small budget and several objective suggest that there may lack clarity the design instrument focus the intervention most instrument already have relatively small and the problem compound the lack specialized because more resource require attend multiple objective many intervention with small budget and complex purpose raise important question about the potential effectiveness the policy mix most instrument assume that money the only barrier achieve change the innovation system this assumption can infer from the fact that most instrument use grant match grant the mechanism intervention the dominance subsidy not unusual present many country must keep mind that grant assume that the only problem that need resolution from the public intervention perspective lack money and that all other factor contribute productivity and competitiveness available reachable money make available this assumption almost certainly false highly unlikely that this the true condition the system any other nascent innovation system grant can sometimes have negative effect the potential negative effect can include market distortion for disadvantage other business that not receive thereby distort investment and other economic activity grant dependency for create organization that cannot compete without grant subsidy and rely continued public support and for increase the incentive for firm lobby the government instead engage productive activity given the stage development suggest that such effect not concern this time important review the effectiveness grant agent change for recent work technology adoption suggest that managerial practice and the lack knowledge and skill within the firm often great barrier adoption than the access the material technology grant solely for technology acquisition likely have limit impact many instrument use multiple intervention mechanism that unlikely effective all their dimension numerous instrument invoke multiple causal mechanism influence the system addition the previous observation about the small scale great majority instrument and the diversity their very difficult for them effective all these dimension given the complexity multiple type the administrative cost these instrument very likely exceed their specific budget and significantly reduce their chance impact different mechanism typically require capability that not complementary and rarely find one agency office the same time instrument that have multiple form intervention may create challenge for efficient administration and should review addition the diversity objective and type many instrument also indicate multiple type beneficiary all the comment the multiplicity intervention mechanism applicable here the best practice for manage public instrument suggest specialization term even within the same class this finding another reason recommend rationalization instrument the lack specialization among instrument focus the private sector may further challenge their effectiveness there little specialization among instrument focus the private sector many them simultaneously target firm several size and life cycle stag firm different size and stage the life cycle face very different challenge and have different need experience indicate that each these business activity segment require special skill serve them for the policy support small startup with potentially work field emerge may very different from the policy need support smes general very difficult for uniform set intervention effectively address all these issue simultaneously small instrument with such ambitious spectrum care requirement highly unlikely have such capability worth consider these instrument address good characterization firm need target their intervention where target this may sometimes the creation new venture for several instrument target mature firm regardless their size than for firm the very early stage start this may potentially reinforce the role incumbent rather than encourage the growth innovative startup several instrument available only firm that already profitable experience from other country suggest that many startup that high growth and ultimately very profitable may undergo considerable during which they focus growth and many instrument specifically target establish technology high technology readiness level that technology supportive innovation ecosystem need provide support for technology across the spectrum technology from the laboratory the market very few instrument address management with foreign market access academic research indicate that these play important role technology adoption and export but these area receive little attention although skill formation and technology transfer seem the two most common objective for none the instrument examine this study strictly dedicate these objective business and individual entrepreneur have little direct many business accelerator and incubator important role such organization appear have both relatively low number instrument and relatively small overall budget direct towards them individual oppose firm also have very little direct there consistent weakness the logic model instrument the functional analysis the instrument show that logic model generally the associate outcome and incentive the logic model well mediocre justification the may possibly link with the origin some instrument some the starting point for the development instrument appear not have the internal identification market failure and the subsequent development logic but rather desire follow the direction the and the priority axis important fully understand the rationale and logic the commission and translate this into logic model for each instrument clear logic model and justification will then support numerous other aspect each instrument such more specific objective and good accounting improve and consideration alternative instrument budget often this include both undershoot and overshoot this issue likely relate the problem have many intervention with small budget this again suggest that some rationalization expansion the more successful program warrant greater evaluation the instrument level need often weak the instrument level than the program level priority axis level there appear good process for evaluate the overall impact the portfolio and also relatively good process for track and evaluate individual project that support specific instrument evaluation and comparison the instrument themselves seem less clear improving this will allow good decision about how rationalize the policy mix the administrative structure several instrument appear many instrument structure with and this seem very likely introduce some additional friction and cost although this structure may necessary condition for some important pay close attention the interface between organization process may help assess this friction and determine whether improve worsen over time the dual role rule and regulation perceive well neighbor that also receive structural fund the positive origination rule for engagement with stakeholder constructive element follow guidance set the instrument along the the the country the other some area compliance with the rule substitute for good functionality because more technically sophisticated logic model and indicator useful for guide and implementation generally not develop beyond minimum compliance requirement the project not have sufficient information similarity and difference with nationally funded instrument carry out comparison implementation capacity require further examination there suggestion from the support both ecosystem stakeholder and other world bank that implementation capacity might significant constraint chapter improve policy mix and functionality entrepreneurship the following present recommendation improve the functionality the exist policy mix with indicative activity that can accomplish within year and medium term activity that can accomplish within year many these activity categorize due the confluence the period the timing this exercise coincide with review and development new operational from this analysis can apply the future policy especially when come improve program which impact how program and evaluate rationalize the overall portfolio reduce the number small instrument that likely ineffective due their scale improve enable good comparison and hence inform ongoing decision about which instrument scale with attention small pilot instrument that may hold promise such evaluation should look both efficiency and follow module and the per methodology clarify the instrument objective that the rationale specific market failure try address and consider instrument that more and specific although instrument can effective and rationalization may push towards few instrument that more general scope the current portfolio instrument likely have dilute impact may also make evaluation and comparison more difficult ensure that the comprehensive set there specialized one design for company the early stage technology readiness and market and for company with aspiration for scale there need more support target towards startup and individual entrepreneur this include address management with foreign firm and market access this also include instrument for skill formation and technology rather than these joint objective alongside should have explicit logic model hypothesize chain cause and effect lead the desire outcome further development such model link with clear justification for each and should enable good accounting improve the well prompt idea for alternative instrument further support business include accelerator and incubator most these have important role although such organization currently have relatively small overall budget direct towards them consider range mechanism besides tailor appropriately type firm and stage firm useful mechanism for the early stage include startup and firm with risky business who often rely for other type loan tax and reform public procurement may effective grant some while have less effect market and reduce the risk term continue reduce the administrative burden applicant many instrument show good sign have simplify otherwise reform make easy for applicant the fact that many applicant still rely consultant and advisor indicate that there room for further improvement term aware the administrative burden staff apparent from interview that the burden audit and other internal administration considerable cost the management many instrument particularly where instrument this will reduce their impact there may opportunity increase staff motivation term formalize learning and make good use available data although there clearly process for the systematic improvement these could further develop there may value use the program analyze instrument far and understand how make adjustment this will far enhance when combine with logic model

recent reform have improve current public procurement process and platform still perceive difficult access for startup and other small firm pub with particular attention the need innovative can expand the domestic market for startup while simultaneously help bring beneficial innovation into the public sector significant reform the public procurement system world bank recommend conduct rapid analysis exist public procurement and system identify how oppose other msmes can well integrate into the public procurement system this should also seek identify the extent which startup applicant and winner tender this analysis may benefit from review how other country approach inclusion young firm within their public procurement order identify common barrier for suggest the review consider whether startup and other msmes exclude through the use qualification criterion such international organization for standardization iso certification indemnity whether public body tender for assume the use legacy technology and and thus inadvertently exclude innovative solution whether large tender can break into small piece order fall within the capacity small firm and whether tender advertise sufficient time allow small firm identify these and respond appropriately the review should also attempt measure the proportion public procurement process that publicize through the exist system for whether this fact percent well the percentage respondent and successful winner that oppose other msmes although data concern applicant and winner tender publish the public procurement agency annually for recommend that this data should ideally make available ideally with application program interface the increase the openness and timeliness data concern procurement will assist identify sector body that able work more effectively with startup and hence suggest practice that might adopt other body suggest that there may benefit experiment with novel procurement model such challenge model that have use effectively elsewhere drive innovation and encourage new supplier providing training procurement personnel concern such innovative procurement well the difference involve work with may also beneficial this could potentially manage the propose agency startup ecosystem hub see recommendation below the implementation body for this reform the national public procurement under the general

translational role the education system and partnership with industry and university staff include management can play many important role stimulate inspiring student and cultivate entrepreneurial provide entrepreneurial directly assist the formation and transfer technology exist young firm enable them become more innovative most these function than other country although have high share and mathematics stem this have not translate into high number innovative startup many lead entrepreneurial university such the school university the institute technology and many aim complement formal entrepreneurship education with campus extracurricular include acceleration and even access from the university this type practical education help support the change culture and within the university and create startup the quality entrepreneurship education particular concern although there have numerous program improve entrepreneurial many entrepreneur still complain that their university education not provide them with appropriate knowledge with academic teaching entrepreneurship perceive low insufficiently practical and disconnect from experience this exacerbate the fact that many teacher and lecture staff have limit exposure the private sector entrepreneurial skill also pose considerable challenge university include staff responsible for overall and and academic development university technology transfer office relatively undeveloped many other university important contributor the total number especially the end the spectrum functional review the r&d system world bank that examine the institutional framework for commercialization find that technology transfer capability potentially hamper the formation well other mechanism such and contribute the low level innovation amongst firm there some evidence that university file patent merely satisfy the requirement and mostly without clear commercialization strategy limited resource and the lack strategic approach also mean that most patent application never proceed beyond local filing and not take the patent treaty phase beyond the lack linkage between research organization and firm have significant impact upon discuss the following recommendation well the output various approach improve linkage the world bank current innovation project this project support the effort build the institutional capacity region design and implement regional innovation entrepreneurship support program base international good practice under this the world bank build the capacity the regional design and roll out innovation program the conclusion that project should read alongside these suggest that this section should read with reference the there may opportunity combine entrepreneurial skill train with digital skill train discuss under the digital and need the intervention discuss this section with the intervention the following section innovation foster knowledge into the private with that recommend that several action would improve entrepreneurship education for for career counselor and university well building entrepreneurial capability within these and engagement with the ecosystem removing regulatory for entrepreneurial education exposure successful entrepreneur may expect inspire and encourage prospective well help entrepreneurial education remain relevant and date many ecosystem member believe that the regulation for guest lecturer school and university prevent entrepreneur and mentor without teach qualification from speak student these regulation should relax clarify allow educational institution provide student with more direct exposure and industry expert with and industry facilitate knowledge transfer well invite guest university should improve and encourage mobility between the private sector and more broadly this may require change staff recruitment policy for common for academic institution place heavy emphasis the publication history academic but the output paper likely reduce while work industry educator training study for exist university professor and lecturer increase their practical knowledge about and ensure that this propose program the include facilitate lecturer exchange program inviting entrepreneur visit lead institution well study visit academic staff visit highly entrepreneurial university and startup ecosystem abroad closer link between university and enabler organization could also part this action metrics for entrepreneurship entrepreneurial education obligation university attempt facilitate technology and report the impact insufficient for entrepreneurial behavior amongst staff and student suggest the need develop and implement specific incentive both institutional level and individual level high and other formal and informal education order encourage both entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial education these incentive may specific public that link with entrepreneurial outcome they could also reward entrepreneurial experience industry involvement staff with fast promotion even specify this requirement for career progression the allocation free time entrepreneurial activity the prestige award accompany suggest that the annual metric for enterprise engagement that university require publish should expand include wide range entrepreneurship and enterprise activity this might include the number student participate startup event for and business plan competition the number student receive enterprise education the number student staff attend practical residency the number student advisory council for educational ensure that entrepreneurship education remain relevant recommend the establishment advisory group council public representative and key stakeholder from the startup ecosystem angel industry representative and this body would work with and institution help identify possible ongoing educational reform the same body could also advise the action above term determine metric that member consider most relevant and term advocate for other measure that may promote mobility and enterprise awareness such expansion research valorization fund the world bank project innovation pilot the application research valorization grant two region such grant not intend fund basic but test demonstrate the potential for the commercial application previous research activity may include market research and demonstrate technical feasibility and compliance for that technology can meet particular industry requirement and recommend that this pilot scheme review and expand suggest that grant range from around per project for market research and industry engagement around for production prototype and demonstrator would with the expectation fund program per year per region should require demonstrate clearly how the propose valorization activity will increase the prospect commercialization emphasize that the purpose such not fund for the entire journey from lab but help develop promising idea the point where they have sufficiently find traction and from the private sector this require that the private sector sufficiently capable and continue which likely depend upon complementary action include other recommendation within this report therefore recommend that this program closely monitor ensure that the size grant and and that the stage development the technology sufficiently mature institutional capacity and research staff develop great entrepreneurial awareness and demand for the fund likely increase ongoing the fund therefore and should consider expand the fund appropriate expansion technology transfer capability building program the world bank innovation project have also pilot grant for program within university recommend expansion this program suggest that should make available support the national network for innovation and technology transfer develop and promote good practice and training course should also provide connect individual staff more closely with international network such the association science and technology and the association university technology order increase exposure good practice this should conjunction with the recommendation above concern clarification and regulation relate ownership and commercialization better use research development infrastructure one mode collaboration between startup and other firm and university concern the use research facility and infrastructure many university possess significant publicly fund facility for specialist manufacture rapid testing and inspection facility that unaffordable for firm but that may significant benefit develop innovative product and service much this infrastructure have but remain poorly signpost startup and other with lack clarity concern the process which firm may obtain access therefore propose pilot accessibility program this pilot program would seek identify suitable incentive for university share their well

see annex list with startup and digital nomad for table country that provide immigration incentive for and investor recommend startup visa scheme provide simple for immigrant entrepreneur investor wish relocate suggest that development startup visa program should start with review international identify good practice suggest that effective startup visa scheme likely have policy objective that clearly identify potential desirable from attract entrepreneur digital nomad assessment the likely cost the with the fiscal cost incentive systematically track and publish this should also consider indirect such what may happen enter race with other jurisdiction for talent clear information about program that provide applicant and accessible format simple process for applicant objective assessment process with clear guideline for assessment that minimize opportunity for malfeasance that clearly lay out law and not negotiate basis that link clearly defined policy objective mechanism that can verify whether the policy objective startup visa accomplish and can evaluate the the scheme support and involvement from ecosystem who willing assess business plan and sponsor application effective safeguard that prevent abuse recommend expansion the exist scheme because there likely benefit for startup arise from increase concentration digitally experience even such individual not themselves various study have show that promote such mobility stimulate exchange idea that foster and encourage economic growth other possible effect include usage which can help push adoption within implementation this recommendation likely require collaboration between the ministry innovation and digitalization the ministry interior the ministry foreign and the ministry labor and social

through diplomatic mission and leverage the founder and network see recommendation above critical market the domestic market for many digital startup inhibit low level digital skill and limited use platform among the general public see also recommendation export rate among firm also very low comparison with other country many entrepreneur report dissuade from export because they not understand the condition and culture overseas and not know where start this exacerbate the overseas network the lack understanding startup amongst trade and relate civil servant and lack appropriate skill and confidence amongst entrepreneur there also lack support from government and trade office abroad for startup seek internationalize many entrepreneur report poor perception startup which may present further barrier exporter there evidence suggest once firm start further expansion into other overseas market easy therefore recommend that attention focus persuade startup take their and begin export other country have seek make this easy provide overseas facility where exporter can find before develop good local connection one example landing which network physical location key market that provide flexible office space and support establish local connection there need for good strategic advice there tendency for firm target such rather than base their choice market knowledge exist trade connection and recommend that start with analysis barrier export for digital startup and innovative firm this should examine other startup internationalization program identify good identify critical market and strategy for landing and understand the presence and possible support per the recommendation above such study will inform the following action encouraging economic commercial within diplomatic mission embassy and consulate locate key market promote startup for through specialized event involve entrepreneur and key stakeholder from local startup improving the reputation startup through annual showcase leading firm and talent global startup event this should include participation reputable international event such global startup the should make available for attendance such

private sector foster knowledge into startup and the private sector leverage university and research and development institute research and development and startup founder the previous recommendation improve entrepreneurship education and strengthen the role the ecosystem seek stimulate the supply innovation from public research this supply not meet with corresponding demand from within the private then unlikely result more innovation bring market this recommendation therefore aim encourage the demand side innovation within the private which currently relatively weak comparison with other country this recommendation not intend address the gap relate technology adoption and innovation that exist within which recognize but which beyond the scope this report despite large investment r&d infrastructure public sector investment not translate into private sector nor there substantial demand from private sector firm build upon the innovation university and research institute mention

type although especially large the innovation new product see figure firm have low production have around patent application per billion regional gross domestic product purchase power standard this contrast with and each filing over patent application per billion and innovation leader such filing over patent application per billion commission one important reason for this the lack strong linkage between firm and university various measure collaboration and collaboration between innovative smes and other organization for commission suggest that lag counterpart this regard this mean that public

process organization and marketing source note innovation the implementation new significantly improve product good service marketing organizational method business workplace external relation the union member state exclude the united kingdom r&d r&d appear inadequate stimulate the necessary activity firm and relatively limited comparison with many country total direct government business percentage well below the average and commission allocate billion billion the last period business r&d support one important incentive mechanism r&d tax credit current r&d relief have remain relatively unchanged recent year and permit deduction percent cost comparison many other country offer much more generous relief for the united kingdom r&d tax relief scheme permit super deduction percent qualify r&d cost for smes therefore recommend expansion r&d relief although r&d tax credit effective stimulate r&d and van such scheme still require that firm fund the r&d prior claim relief this incentive thus more helpful for scale firm than for drive r&d young startup and other firm that not yet revenue positive discuss the policy mix see part one this section there already bias the exist mix instrument towards profitable firm increasing r&d tax credit unlikely correct this bias and may exacerbate for this recommend that expansion r&d credit accompany direct grant for target specifically startup and small firm note part one this often not the primary target exist instrument such grant should develop with consideration the various recommendation part one for they should have specific focus low administrative burden for low bureaucratic burden for clear logic for the and robust evaluation this likely also require expansion the institutional capacity distribute such the grant should with the startup investment fund see recommendation above startup previously grant and equity investment may displace each other degree because cost for grant and tax relief will depend both the exact design the the definition qualify r&d and the uptake recommend that new instrument pilot for limited period order gauge with budget allocate for comprehensive evaluation the scheme encouraging for collaborative research many country encourage collaborative research between firm and research organization use collaborative research which restrict collaborative partnership consortium such collaboration know encourage the exchange both explicit knowledge and tacit with university collaboration associate with product and chun and mun research consortium may also particularly helpful reduce failure and stimulate research other research low that difficult for any one firm capture for own competitive advantage that there reduced incentive for any one firm invest even benefit the sector whole suggest that collaboration formation and consortium formation should encourage through the creation new collaborative research grant explicitly require the involvement least one university partner and least one private sector firm ideally sme the scheme could initially target towards solve specific societal such climate change for which open call for proposal invite consortium partnership should lead private sector order ensure focus commercial application suggest that university partner should still have their cost fund and that private sector partner may potentially receive subsidy their eligible depend the firm size and the nature the project with the action this likely also require expansion institutional capacity order administer the scheme knowledge transfer recommend that and both explicit and tacit further promote through the public knowledge transfer secondment such scheme would subsidize the secondment member academic staff into firm for with the specific purpose encourage knowledge transfer could potentially also operate reverse subsidize the movement industry researcher into university other research institution would but tailor the need the firm for secondment under the knowledge transfer scheme fund the united kingdom engineering and physical research council may last between week and year secondment should appraise include senior determine the quality and feasibility the propose and the likely business impact that may result from knowledge transfer the scheme could potentially manage the regional level establishment the scheme will need address regulatory issue within university that may inhibit the mobility researcher innovation the recommendation above propose scheme encourage and other research organization make available their research equipment and infrastructure complement propose scheme target startup and other firm subsidize the cost research relate the use these facility this would take the form which would use public fund pay for portion r&d cost qualified research organization suggest that the value the voucher should relatively with the application process for voucher

underscore the importance this following the recommendation the world bank group report the digital suggest address digital skill multiple level primary and secondary student should expose basic and other digital skill early primary school the education board should update tertiary education curriculum meet change skill requirement for include understanding technology see and and world bank for more detailed analysis future skill need can ensure that their curriculum remain relevant with guidance from the advisory council for educational reform suggest recommendation given the pace technological lifelong learn opportunity should supply for all and should include not only technical skill but also skill for adaptability one example how encourage basic skill development society see which establish the national digital and coalition decrease the digital skill gap focus program that can train large portion the population digital skill the coalition include service and information technology train company have develop and training initiative that aim lessen the digital skill gap the purpose these activity lower the number people that not use computer the percent union also embed digital skill within primary and secondary education ensure that future equip with basic and above basic digital the implementation body for this activity the ministry and digitalization with the ministry the ministry labor and social solidarity and the authority for the digitalization attach the ministry innovation and this activity will take several year materialize cost for pilot program range from million million term percentage individual with basic digital skill percentage individual with above basic digital skill percentage individual shop percentage individual bank outcome increase use service increase use digital platform component improving managerial managerial capability promote adoption and use digital technology can contribute the use transactional contribute the development digital economy smes managerial practice important for digitalization harness the benefit digital technology need complementary and the firm that benefit the most from digital technology those that also have good access key and organizational skill low managerial lack skill and poor matching worker job curb digital technology adoption and hence the rate and complementary management practice and because small firm typically have bad management the impact may less for such and van firm that have good management practice more prone adopt digital technology and faster the government should pilot managerial skill train alongside digital education for smes increase productivity the government can also introduce incentive for collaboration among such through voucher for innovation the case strengthen managerial capability drive performance leverage digital incentive should address the main barrier for manager drive namely preference and behavioral information weak external and internal need complementary and lack trust program should the one hand encourage the assimilation and demand digital technology through focus managerial capability and the other support the supply digital technology for entrepreneur manager public intervention should generate enable condition for digitalization program typically facilitate tailor and often provide financial support for entrepreneur overarch program provide tool for complementary both managerial and financial main type intervention include managerial capability digital maturity assessment tool conduct expert and access tailor designing and deploy business provision financial such voucher and grant for managerial test new digital technical assistance and business advisory and enable condition for digital access awareness and provision public good such training course the implementation body for this activity the ministry and digitalization transactional technology well match supply and demand facilitate market transaction lower information asymmetry include digital platform and the uptake digital could remain superficial and may not fully benefit from productivity transformation need for firm recovery need continuously invest managerial skill but may lack resource and awareness how accomplish this cost for pilot program range from million million term number firm use digital platform number firm invest innovation number manager digital productivity tool increase digital adoption firm digital uptake firm this recommendation much broad than the related

note and evaluation process hard gauge all but one the instrument have above score these score due mostly the system that use for capture all information for the instrument and the project they support the exact adaptation this system process for individual instrument difficult gauge the high score this indicator seem somewhat contradictory with the low score objective and outcome impact that would build towards this score may overestimate the quality the design the instrument level best system that well connect with the program itself and the quality key performance indicator for the
