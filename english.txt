a closer of the function of select support program the section the mix the number and of the portfolio of instrument with regard to their object type of bene and so on the second section the assess the function and govern of select support program this it limit it was base on program data a limit number of interview and research between late and mid and had to make sever it follow close the of the two stage of the per and reason indic both on the of the mix and program function this review did not cover instrument by the invest fund or look in detail at the public fund of research or transfer thus part one indic area where data collect and would be need to con some of the on present in this report nevertheless the clear es sever area where there is scope for particular it make suggest about reform to the mix and gap in support as well as to the design implement and govern of instrument key find mix the current portfolio of is high cant are to a few instrument and a long tail of much smaller instrument that are like to be below their optimum scale ration or scale some of these smaller instrument ought to be most instrument have top level object for some instrument product object with job creation object this may suggest a lack of in the design of with the number of small instrument this suggest that few are like to target import object and some are like to be there are gap in level object we recommend the develop of instrument that address practic with foreign and market access as a mean of top level object there are import gap in support for entrepreneur and stage there is special among instrument focus on the sector we recommend the develop of more target instrument for stage pro t and well as the organ that e s support such such as and some instrument may the role of rather than the growth of most instrument have differ typic differ that are not and are rare found in one or of ce at the same time we mend that instrument that be review

about which instrument should be scale up and which may need to be burden for mani bene are still high there been a cant effort by to the process for support scheme and the for there are still indic that these process remain over complex for for the fact that and often need to hire consult and advisor in order to for govern support scheme is an indic that the process are over complex this may have the effect of shift support away from the stage where it is most need bureaucrat burden for are also cant audit of instrument time appear to a cant burden on team bureaucrat friction is like to

with direct or indirect to entrepreneurship were thus program that support sector digit were retain for some of these pro gram might bene t digit program to digit of govern were budget data was extract from avail document and are like this data was base on public avail document concern the instrument as well as a common data portal for mani of the fund program the data set was not with some program have no budget data it is therefor import to note sever caveat data might be skew by extern report factor second where program had no budget data were made base on past program or other which might be third some program cover a wide rang of entrepreneurship in such case the of spend that was was base on number report by the author mas at the program level fourth some instrument target such as size or object where this was the case the total budget of the instrument was equal between the budget were standard over time the year of implement for instrument were standard ing that the start year was the year of the call and that the end year was the project end year with eu fund run to as per unless state the total budget of the instrument was then even by the number of year from the start year until the project end year the result were by the number of year pass launch and sum up in the case of call although we that the real spend pro of mani program is to be spread uniform in this way this aver age allow an comparison of budget for program of differ length we also that in the case of instrument with call there is an regard overlap call the may lead us incorrect to that a greater of the budget is spent in year where call overlap should be care given the various caveat about the data and the process the level of is not percent therefor and recommend made within this report should be treat with caution even though they tend to mirror c p m a find budget the mix some instrument with a budget over billion these g ure to the total budget fund but invest over the period under consider the avail data for of fund show that eu fund versus nation fund is in a ratio of this nation and sector fund that may be by public fund although this ratio should be interpret cautious there are miss of for sever nation instrument a over one quarter of the mix entrepreneurship as it core object thirteen of the with a total budget of million have entrepreneurship as an explicit goal the remain ing three quarter of the mix to r d or digit these may be indirect to entrepreneurship or the develop of the ecosystem standard budget over time an annual budget of million as dis cuss instrument vari in if one adjust for this each instrument s budget over the instrument s year of and then sum these the total annual budget amount to million altern if one that all spend will occur within the current seven year fund period as use for eu instrument then the annual may instead be at around million this that the budget of each instrument is equal over their year of it also that all instrument are which is of the most recent period under but not for year low absorpt mean that this is like an of actual the fact that a budget been doe not mean that the amount were actual spent or that the project it is mon that veri low absorpt is the of budget that are actual spent in time this occur for sever reason a lack of at various level data from indic that this absorpt rate was percent for program by the human program percent for the region and as low as percent for the in what follow we have typic refer to the budget this better re government it should be note that the

instrument is that there are mani small that may not have the scale to have an impact even if they are well design and although it is not to such a of budget a similar pattern is found in other tri it is import to that at the instrument level the smaller instrument may a disproportion effort more than half the instrument in this set less than million annual object in term of general object the pro

recommend for the design implement and govern of the s portfolio the assess the function rather than the impact of support instrument function here refer to the of process in creat and implement each instrument the design implement m e system human and govern the instrument s and interact with other program and method the for the is base on a framework to best practic the framework develop by the world bank score support program along a total of to program design to implement and to program see annex b instrument for the overview of instrument see annex c detail find of the function for more detail from the function the approach for the data cation the function of each program is score on a scale of to for each where intern best practic a score of should not be interpret as aver age but as a function aspect that is but room for of function indic world bank group design design implement implement govern govern c f unction a the aim to reveal whether key element of effect have been met in three key area design public must be design through a process cover by the rule of law and consist with general nation or region goal for research and they must be proper and address real problem avoid the trap of address this cation can also help avoid of public by certain vest bene a system is er should the full rang of altern design rather than exist pro gram by design should follow a clear well logic model that help depict the share relationship and causal between program input output and and logic connect them to higher level object logic model should de ne indic for input output and that allow for m e of program perform implement process for the program select and report should be clear and and system should be in place to allow for learn and of the instrument dure implement implement must have human and to the program and staff should have train and that are to program perform rather than generic to public staff intern and extern m e of the instrument should take place and critic result should be use to and adapt the program govern should be in place to minim overlap and between the instrument and other program and implement staff should also be of extern law and that can inhibit the implement of the instrument and should be in take step to adapt for of the instrument this cover nine instrument support cover the period to these nine instrument around billion of the billion of the total fund around percent mani of the remain set of instrument fall under the same program and and so will share some similar characterist the key and interview which the of eu fund and invest the of public work develop and public and the of were for the of the bulk of the instrument in the mix instrument total billion of the billion and in mani case con that other instrument were design and in similar fashion to those one under thus although the function nine instrument there is reason to that this re the mix nevertheless the and from this should be view as indic of but not as the small may not mani area of interest regard practic that affect the function of the set of the was base on semi interview interview were with key staff from the instrument concern each score by a team compos of a minimum of three interview in order to tri to minim inter viewer bias on interview were for one instrument either of an instrument was split across organ or cation was need it is import to note that the nation author were not the client of this project and agre to at the request of region author as a result the project did not have the intern to connect with the project s as an for learn and therefor the interview were not as inform and lack the detail about and tacit that was made avail for the function in other some inform was glean from report by rather than the program the percept of cannot for direct report from the c f unction a overview of find s score show some area that are ripe for some score are higher than other in there is cant within indic when the score in comparison to the and minimum score for each indic across the set of instrument in the we discuss design implement govern and to sever of the area show in from eu in general eu appear to have had a posit impact on function in the program origin m e and we also note area where unclear or eu rule may have to low score particular in the use of logic model and the consider of altern instrument we suggest that it would help author to more clear between and function these are not the same and eral instrument appear to a focus on the former at the of the latter design among the design indic those to the use of logic model account of input and and the proper cation and of special attent the area of for are re in the indic with lower score in the problem area have score below the of the rang or point of the high score for program origin is also the remain indic have score slight re better practic es but with room for the exist and of a logic model and the proper of input and are two area of concern the lower score of these indic reveal a dis connect between the of the of the instrument and the cost incur to implement it given that of input and tie direct to the to such cost the of the de of object of the and the of and impact are other area of concern for object are often self statement to the need for the in in other word in the case of fund the object of an instrument is to fund ing in a certain area there is fund or support in that area this sort of statement of is circular and beg the question of the must support it and what are expect from it the program origin good practic in general which is explain by the process by the opera of the eu framework these process are high formal document and good rational for of instrument in their fund scheme this avoid to reason or in it is that this origin also affect of some other design more than comment that design of an instrument had been or in by the rather than have been design by the author itself follow a consider of various altern the high score for of an m e system further the score for this is main due to the exist of a central data gather and report system which offer good infra for data and inform when it come to m e it is well known from other tri that such central system are often tailor to general govern invest and and so do not c item that are tailor to and score for design indic world bank group c f unction a the fact that both object and are not as good rais the question of how the in to the instrument implement most of the from the interview reveal that program did not distinguish the object input output and of project from the or instrument and it appear that m e was often at the instrument level than at the program level or level support project do not automat to success and so the of these instrument may not be good enough to in the even if each project within it good result therefor the design of the m e system may not be what the instrument need we therefor recommend that this aspect of function is in closer detail in the implement among the implement indic and select criteria budget and with perform are of concern the implement indic to budget staff and process monitor have lower score score on these indic fall below the of the scale as shown in below the process re the side of the bene ie in to submit and expect a in a time manner there is some across instrument but the of labor in process ing with differ role given to differ and technic assess for exam and some in veri cation process limit time the budget indic score is low this re the that mani instrument have in it and not have a good understand of the demand for the c focus in the design of the solicit there were problem with both undershoot and overshoot suggest that instrument budget are not design with instrument goal instrument are not hire special human connect perform assess with program goal or monitor for most of the report on and indic a of with the and avail of human the score may the actual it was common to hear dure interview that the public system under general rule and the did not think much of the between those and the of the under there is consensus in develop nation and the liter on of public support for r d and that special human are with approach to public in this vein the perform assess of staff was not to the content of the instrument this disconnect between perform assess and program goal occur in other area and is the general establish process of public similar the process of public were not monitor for which is re in it lower score implement further we suspect that implement is lack in as it is in neighbor for which function were also conduct reason to suspect that this may be a constraint the fact that some instrument did not seem to have enough skill staff nor mani for their own staff this is by from other world bank project such as the in s catch up project as well as from ecosystem we were to this in detail as our research did not allow direct of the work nor was the govern the client we suggest that it warrant closer attent score for implement indic world bank group note m e monitor and c f unction a mani instrument were in a way that is like to cost it is that mani instrument were in a way that both an ma and an work in this was general report as work with clear de from a as well as from practic of similar in other tri it seem that this will some friction and cost for in case adjust are need dure instrument implement or due to of reg or rule this might call for consult and such as these were found in all other in the region where a function was conduct and a follow up of this may be to assess the proper of this of labor to understand whether the function of ani instrument is affect govern the found good intern and extern with program within the and with other as shown in below this is part program within the s axe have some built in in some case those could be further to more on the program the function also found sever es of entrepreneurship program be constrain by state aid rule this was due to the state aid rule not be well adjust to the support by govern these rule are not to chang and were typic of these rule and their constraint but cannot chang or their effect from there is cant in the score across indic for this set of instrument indic for learn within refer to how well instrument score against the best case scenario accord to global practic higher score are code in green score are code in yellow and lower score are code in red the radar graph in of

these are the origin of instrument and their practic these two indic bene t from that establish clear rule for these area of design and implement account for product of the instrument cation of bene and select criteria in design and to learn from with the instrument are other area of better practic there is some more on the m e by design that is in this quadrant by a small margin which is to how well adjust the central digit platform use for m e is to the need of c instrument see annex c detail find of the function for more detail from the function chapter c c the lead to various about the mix and function of the instrument that is use to entrepreneurship the that may be drawn is that the of spend on a few instrument mani smaller instrument that may be within the collect of instrument at the nation level the spend is high on a few instrument the instrument amount to about half the year budget while three of the instrument account for half the total year budget this high mean that the is compos of mani instrument with small budget that are probabl not of scale to have an impact given that some of the cost are like to be second the with the small scale of mani instrument is compound by the fact that mani of them aim for sever object along with the high of the budget on a few instrument mani instrument attempt to a divers of object both general object and c object and there is overlap between them the of a number of instrument with small budget and sever object suggest that there may be lack of in the design of instrument to focus the most instrument have a small scale and the problem is compound by the lack of special focus more are to attend to object have mani with small budget and complex rais an import question about the effect of the mix third most instrument that money is the barrier to chang in the this can be infer from the fact that most instrument use grant or match grant as the of the of grant base is not it is present in mani tri it must be kept in mind that grant that the problem that need from the public is lack of money and that all other factor to product and are avail or if money is made avail this is almost certain it is high that this is the true of the system in or ani other nascent system grant can have e the effect can market dis for other that do not grant distort invest and other grant depend for creat organ that cannot without grant or and so on public support and for the for to the govern instead of in product given the stage of develop of s ecosystem we suggest that such effect are not a concern at this time nevertheless it is import to review the effect of grant as agent of chang in for recent work on adopt suggest that practic and the lack of and skill within the is often a greater barrier to adopt than the access to the itself so grant sole for are like to have limit impact mani instrument use that are to be e in all of their sion instrument causal to in the system in to the about the small scale of a great major of instrument and the divers of their object it is veri cult for them to be effect in all these given the expect complex of type of the cost of these instrument is veri like to exceed their c budget and sig ni cant their of impact differ typic that are not and are rare found in one or of ce at the same time therefor instrument that have form of may creat for and should be review in to the divers of object and type of mani instrument also indic type of bene all the comment on the of are here the best practic for public instrument suggest special in term of bene even within the same class this is reason to recommend a ration of instrument the lack of special among instrument focus on the sector may further their e there is special among instrument focus on the sector mani of them c c target of sever size and life stage of differ size and stage of the life face veri differ and have differ need indic that each of these seg special skill to them for the to support a small with high growth ambit work in a eld of may be veri differ from the need to support in general it is veri cult for a uniform set of to effect address all these is sue small instrument with such an spectrum of care are high ly to have such it is worth ne tune these instrument to address a better of need by target their in where target exist this may be to the creation of new high growth for sever instrument are target at regardless of their size than for in the veri stage of start up this may the role of rather than the growth of in sever instrument are avail to that are pro from other suggest that mani that are high growth and veri pro may undergo a consider period dure which they are focus on growth and user adopt mani instrument calli target establish at high tech level that is market a support system need to support for across the spectrum of from the to the market veri few instrument address practic with foreign or market access research indic that these play an import role in adopt and export respect but these area attent although skill format and transfer seem to be the two most common object for instrument none of the instrument by this were strict to these object and entrepreneur have direct fund in mani ecosystem and play an import role such organ appear to have both a low number of instrument and a small budget direct toward them entrepreneur as to also have veri direct fund there are consist weak in the logic model of instrument the function of the instrument show that logic model were general weak as were the model input object and weak in the logic model of instrument as well as cation of the program may be link with the origin of some instrument in some case the start point for the develop of an instrument appear not to have been the intern cation of a market and the develop of a logic model but rather a to follow the direct of the and the object it is import to understand the rational and logic of the s and to this into a logic model for each instrument a clearer logic model and cation will then support other aspect of each instrument s develop such as more c object and better account of input target and consider of altern instrument instrument budget were often size this both undershoot and overshoot this is like to the problem of have mani with small budget this again suggest that some or of the more success program may be warrant greater at the instrument level is need m e was often at the instrument level than at the program level or level there appear to be good process for the impact of the portfolio of instrument and also good process for track and project that are support by a c instrument and comparison of the instrument seem to be less clear this will allow better about how to ration the mix the of sever instrument appear sub mani instrument were with an ma and an this seem veri like to some friction and cost although this may be a for some fund it is import to pay close attent to the c c between organ process monitor may help assess this friction and whether it is or worsen over time in general the dual role of rule and was in as well as it neighbor that also eu fund on the posit side origin of rule for with are construct element of follow to set up the along the axe of the in the on the other hand in some area with the rule is for better function more technic logic model and indic use for m e and implement general are not develop beyond minimum the project did not have inform on similar and or differ with nation fund instrument to out a comparison implement further there were suggest from the research support both by ecosystem and other world bank research that implement might be a constraint chapter recommend to mix and function of entrepreneurship program c r to i p m

within year mani of these are as short term due to the con of the program period the time of this with s review and develop of new program lesson from this can be to the mix when it come to program

the instrument s object that is the rational or c market it is tri to address and instrument that are more focus and c although instrument can be effect and ration may push toward instrument that are more general in scope the current portfolio of instrument is like to have a impact it may also make instrument level and comparison more cult short term that in the set of instrument there are special one design for in the stage of and market and for with for scale there need to be more support target toward and entrepreneur this address practic with foreign and market access this also instrument for skill format and transfer rather than these be joint object along side other short term instrument should have an explicit logic model a chain of and effect lead to the further develop of such

region data suggest that the major ecosystem the region are around and the data also suggest that in these other remain high depend upon the ecosystem for talent and and funder flagship p r s ecosystem approach we suggest the need for a program to strengthen ecosystem across the aim of such program would be to build the region to prove and perform and to the connect between in order to

suggest that care consider be given to it establish as a invest fund in order to the de of sector rather than this although the fund could be govern own it is strong recommend that it sec tor partner and a perform driven process for invest se lection and due consider of the need to develop a of deal ow to sustain the develop of sector investor there may be to the network see recommend below to investor in term of fund size and stage there is a particular need for seed and seed stage fund in mania so we suggest that a portion of the fund should be to these stage the ex act size of the fund should be follow the to an of size we note that seed round in were around in with seed round around million a fund of million would thus allow seed invest per year plus ten seed invest per year over a period of year ing no invest and no growth in round size invest would obvious permit a greater number of invest and or allow some of the fund to be for later stage in of the public sector s role in support mani are launch c instrument this list franc chile and mani other though the recent conduct an to inform a fund of fund within the nation and plan stage still appear to be or by this instrument flagship govern support need p r c a fund we further recommend that the fund be develop in with the grant scheme dis cuss below see to foster into the sector be grant may to an extent the need for base or vice at the present time we suggest that both recommend are need it may be to shift from one instrument to the other in to chang ecosystem need implement we suggest that the of research and digit could be for and design of the fund the establish of the fund could be overseen by nation such as the one stop or with be ing overseen by this or by an board in either case we suggest that such the fund should have strong sector investor and govern risk design can or harm the develop of sector sector can lead to poor invest or term that sector investor from invest lack of

and reach of entrepreneurship by the role of the system and partnership with target student and staff rational can play mani import role in entrepreneurship such as dent and an skill direct assist the format of and transfer to exist young to them to be come more most of these function are in than in other pean although a high share of and math stem this not into high number of mani lead such as the school of in finland the of and mani other aim to complement formal entrepreneurship with campus extracurricular ing and even access to fund from the this type of practic help to support the chang of and within the and creat an in campus ecosystem in contrast the of entrepreneurship is a particular concern although there have been program to train mani still complain that their did not them with or skill with teach of entrepreneurship be as low practic and disconnect from real world this is by the fact that mani teacher and staff have limit to the sector skill also pose consider to staff for plan and budget and develop in transfer of are in mani other system are an import contributor to the total number of at the higher end of the spectrum a function review of the r d world bank that the framework for found that transfer were weak hamper the format of as well as other such as and to the low level of amongst there is some that patent mere to the of fund instrument and most without a clear strategi limit flagship govern support need p r i entrepreneurship and strengthen the role of in the ecosystem and the lack of a approach also mean that most patent never pro beyond local ling and are not taken to the patent cooper phase or beyond the lack of between research organ and cant impact upon as discuss in the follow recommend as well as in the interlink output vari approach to are be trial in the world bank s current support in catch up region project this project support the s effort to build the in of catch up region to design and implement region entrepreneurship support program base on intern good practic under this the world bank is build the at the region level to design and roll out program the of that project should be read these recommend approach sever previous project fund by the have tri to skill train and third mission within in a number of high pilot program were implement in the world bank project support in catch ing up region we therefor recommend that a review of these project is new are launch or these program are scale in we suggest that this section should be read with refer to the other calli there may be to skill train with digit skill train as discuss under the digit and a need to the side dis cuss in this section with the demand size of the follow section to foster into the sector with that said we recommend that sever action would entrepreneurship for dent for career counselor and as well as build within these and with the ecosystem for to success entrepreneur may be expect to and prospect as well as help remain and up to date current how ever mani ecosystem member that the for guest at school and prevent entrepreneur and mentor without a teach cation from speak to student these should be relax or to allow to student with more direct to entrepreneur and expert with entrepreneur and expert to transfer as well as guest should and between the sector and more broad this may chang to staff recruit for it is common for to place on the public of staff but the output of paper is like to be while work in p r i entrepreneurship and strengthen the role of in the ecosystem train visit for exist professor and to their practic about and that this is up to date we a program to the in program for entrepreneur to visit lead in as well as fund visit of staff to visit high en and well develop ecosystem abroad closer link between and organ could also be part of this action metric for entrepreneurship exist on to attempt to transfer and to report the pact of this are for behavior amongst staff and student we suggest the need to develop and implement c at both an level and an level for high school and other formal and inform in order to both entrepreneurship and these may be such as c public fund that is link with they could also be non such as reward or by staff with faster or even this a for career progress the cation of free time to or the of award to this we suggest that the annual metric for that are to publish should be expand to a rang of entrepreneurship and enter this might the number of student in event for exam and plan the number of student cation lesson the number of student or staff attend time bound practic in the number of student establish an council for reform to that entrepreneurship remain as as we recommend the es of an group or council of public and key er from the ecosystem angel investor founder and this would work with and to help reform the same could also on the action in term of metric that member most and in term of ing for other that may and such as sponsor studentship p r i entrepreneurship and strengthen the role of in the ecosystem of research valor fund the world bank s project on support in catch up region pilot the of research valor grant in two region such grant are not intend to fund basic re search but to test or the for the of previous research may market research and technic proof of concept and for that a can meet a particular and so on we recommend that this pilot scheme be review and expand we suggest that grant rang from around per project for market research and up to around for product of and would be with the expect of fund ing program per year per region should be to clear how the pro pose valor will the prospect of we that the of such fund is not to fund for the journey from lab to market but to help develop stage idea to the point where they have been ly de risk to traction and fund from the sector this that the sector be and to develop which is like to depend upon action other recommend within this report we therefor recommend that this program is close monitor to that the size of grant and and that the stage of develop of the is as de and as research staff develop greater and intent demand for the fund is like to m e of the fund is therefor import and should expand the fund as of transfer build program the world bank s support in catch up region project also pilot grant for build program within we recommend an of this program calli we suggest that fund should be made avail to support the nation network for and transfer in develop and good practic and train fund should also be to connect staff more close

this is current be pilot by the contract research program be by world bank in with in two region of implement the of with the support of the higher central in of high er program and unit for the of

rational human is vital for the develop of it is well known that for sever year suffer from a brain drain with much top talent the in the work across the globe give rise to new risk of a brain drain talent is poach by oversea and is thus to local the of a the group in the world also creat a cant a network that can support en in expand oversea as well as act as investor and advisor the global of talent also creat to gather idea insight and best practic from across the globe that can be to support the start and scale of in success and have greater and network than the general of tech in there are to the of and in other do so will help rais the pro of the ecosystem among custom in and other ecosystem both market access and foreign invest into see also the recommend below concern up through these recommend should be approach we recommend the creation and of a new network of founder and that connect with ecosystem the core of this network may be use exist of high growth entrepreneur and it may also leader research investor and so on this refer to a of tech by age region and sector that focus on young digit and high tech this subset all in that are under year old and are as digit program and develop and other digit and high this a total of and a of was use in this survey the was strati by region metropolitan area and other region and by sector core digit other digit and high tech the sec tor de was inform by the of similar in the insight data the frame was base on firm which the contact inform for all in the flagship p r b and a network of r founder and the launch of this network should be support by a wide reach market and campaign use of tech popular social media platform and other media this network will a clear for member to join as well as and regular event in order to it remain attract for member to re main we suggest that this may test or pilot in of the network s crea but it may network event host by local or consul to in s nation support strategi media and to success at lead event for slush the electron show member of this network should also be to in a ecosystem build program the object of this will be to transfer gap between ecosystem who lack access to critic and network as well as develop a of back which exist in mani other success ecosystem the network could for help mentor for on export and oversea market con help connect talent with the fund see recommend and help share good practic amongst angel network and although mentor and advisor should be will to their time pro as is the case in other ecosystem this is not yet an es of and so we recommend that be pro to their and commit beyond build for ecosystem the network of success founder and may also act as an group for wish to develop entrepreneurship and program again we suggest that consider be given to implement we suggest that the implement for this reform is the of entrepreneurship and tour ism the network itself could be by one of the ecosystem for the of given that mani of the are alumni it could also be a stand network with risk a key risk is the willing of success founder and to join a network main tain and in this may be to some extent through or total cost for of reform cost establish of network of founder and program for network and of ce cost program of event and oversea network event for for event per year for year program across key ecosystem deepen to ecosystem for for mentor and advisor total million p r b and a network of r founder and formal a founder and network can be accomplish in the short term it will deepen to ecosystem can be in the short to medium term founder and as on critic can be accomplish in the short to medium term s output size of network number of number of total founder founder who are member number of event organ by network number of at event organ by network number of new made between founder and ecosystem number of new made between founder and number of advisor and mentor of found through the network number of angel investor investor in origin connect through the network number of founder and in board align with top to through export recommend scale up through export object help digit grow and scale by widen their market target seek to expand into foreign market rational the market is too small for mani so export is crucial in them to scale up this recommend focus on access of to oversea mar ket through diplomat mission and the founder and network see recommend in critic market the market for mani digit is inhibit by low level of digit skill and limit use of e platform among the general public see also recommend export rate among are also veri low in comparison with other mani report be from export they do not understand the and in oversea market and do not know where to start this is by the under of oversea network by the lack of understand of amongst trade and civil servant and by a lack of skill and con amongst entrepreneur there is also a lack of support from govern and trade of abroad for seek to internation mani entrepreneur report poor percept of abroad which may present a further barrier to export there is suggest that a start export further into other oversea market is easier we therefor recommend that attent be focus on an to take their step and begin export other have sought to make this ea by oversea where time export can a soft land develop better local connect one is s land pad which is a network of physic loca in key market that of ce space and support in establish local connect in there is a need for better to as there is a for an to target market such as rather than base their of market on of exist trade link connect and so on flagship govern support need p r s up through export approach we a of sever it is recommend that start with an of barrier to export for digit and this should other internation pro gram to good practic critic market and a strategi for soft land pad and understand the of and support from as per the such a will inform the follow action within diplomat mission and consul in key market to for through special rais event high entrepreneur and key from local ecosystem the of through an annual of lead and talent at global event this should in intern event or such as global award the disrupt slush fund should be made avail for attend at such event this could be run as a public call open to entrepreneur we also suggest that there may be in led mission to key market this could be an of the exist program to support internation of firm pint but should have a focus on high growth program for this program would aim to the number of export by basic inform about the process and to export and the factor to be when enter foreign market it would build upon the of export barrier to address key concern or gap in amongst the program would also convey inform about trade mission and other develop pilot an intern network of these would be physic in key market for unit state east coast unit state west coast sin to be by

although r d tax credit are effect at r d bloom th and van such scheme still that to fund the r d prior to claim relief this is thus more help for scale than for drive r d in young and other that are not yet posit as was discuss in the mix see part one of this document section there is a bias in the exist mix of instrument toward pro r d tax credit are to correct this bias and may it for this

creat a fund as previous note grant and invest may each other to a cost for grant and tax relief will depend both on the exact design of the instrument the de of r d and the by we recommend that new

for ani one to for it own mean that there is a for ani one to invest in it product even if it bene the sector as a whole we suggest that format and consortium format should be through the creation of a new research grant scheme explicit the of at least one partner and at least one sector ideal an the scheme could ly be target toward c such as chang or sustain for which open call for are respond or partnership should be led by a sector in order to a focus on we suggest that partner should still have their cost fund at percent and that sector partner may a of their cost depend on the size and the of the project as with the action this is like also to an of in order to the scheme establish transfer second we recommend that and transfer both explicit and tacit is further through the public fund of transfer second such a scheme would the second of member of staff into a for a with the c of transfer it could also in revers that is the movement of an research into a or other research second would be time limit but tailor to the need of the for second under the transfer second scheme fund by the unit kingdom s and physic research council may last between week and year second should be by a panel senior to the and p r i z e to foster into the sector of the project and the like impact that may result from transfer the scheme could be at the sub nation region level establish of the scheme will need to address within that may inhibit the of research voucher the recommend a scheme to and other research organ to make avail their research equip and to complement this we pro pose a scheme target at and other to the cost of research to the use of these this would take the form of an voucher which would use public fund to pay for a portion of r d cost in research organ we suggest that the of the voucher should be small with the process for voucher be ly light touch to their adopt for the voucher could pay for up to of use and we suggest that a of match fund ing should be
