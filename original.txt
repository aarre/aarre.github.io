Central America, except for Costa Rica, also exhibits limited capabilities for business scale-up. Formal businesses in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador increase their number of employees at rates lower than 3 percent per year on average, whereas businesses in Costa Rica, Mexico, and Colombia grow at rates that exceed 4 percent (Figure 3). Formal businesses that survive at least 20 years are significantly smaller in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador relative to their regional peers (Figure 4). For example, formal firms in Guatemala employ only 27 workers after at least 20 years, much lower than the average of 55 in Costa Rica and 73 in Mexico.

In Costa Rica, 40 percent of formal firms report having introduced innovations in their production process (Figure 5). However, only 14 percent of formal firms in El Salvador report doing so. Less than 7 percent of manufacturing exports in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are considered high tech (Figure 6), but Costa Rica manufacturing exports double this figure (18.5 percent). Less than 12 percent of businesses in Central America spend on R&D (Figure 7), a third of the fraction spent in Costa Rica (37 percent).

Gaps in the pillars of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador relative to regional peers mirror the performance of the region in entrepreneurship outcomes (Figure 8). The availability of production factors—such as physical capital, human capital, and knowledge—plays a critical role in an innovative entrepreneurship ecosystem. However, relative to their regional peers, Honduras and Guatemala produce with markedly less capital per worker. Moreover, only around 5 percent of the population ages 25 or more in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have completed a tertiary degree, while in Costa Rica this fraction is more than 20 percent (Figure 9). Less than 25 percent of these degrees are in science and engineering (Figure 10).    Figure 8.

LOC AL ENTREPRENEURSHIP ECOSYSTEMS The analysis of spatial correlations in economic activity in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador exploits anonymized records from administrative databases from ministries of economy and tax authorities. (See Table 2.) The data is not directly comparable across countries but is rich enough to offer novel quantitative results. The three databases presumably cover different segments of the business size distribution. For example, whereas the average number of employees per business in the data for Honduras is 4.6, the average size in the data for El Salvador is 29.2. Similarly, sales per business in the data are around USD 21,000 for Honduras, USD 53,000 in Guatemala, and USD 1.7 million in El Salvador. Nonetheless, the data is rich enough to allow the identification of local ecosystems and offer novel quantitative results. The records include the 4-digit ISIC identifier for the economic activity, the locality where the business operates—a municipality in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador—and the age of the business (the date when it was first registered with the administrative authority).

High-tech manufacturing is the industry responsible for producing technology products with a high element of R&D, such as aerospace products, chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, electrical equipment, electronics, motors, and medical and optical instruments (Wolf and Terrell 2016). Tourism includes accommodation services, entertainment activities, food preparation services, and air transportation. Financial services combine financial activities, insurance, and pension services, and BPO includes call centers, management consulting, and administrative support activities. Agribusiness combines agriculture and food processing. Finally, light manufacturing includes textiles, apparel, leather, wood products, and metal products (Dinh et al. 2012 and Dinh 2014).

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGH-TECH MANUFACTURING Businesses in the digital sector and high-tech manufacturing in Central America are potentially more productive than the average firm. Businesses in digital technologies account for a relatively small share of observations (2 percent in Guatemala and 4 percent in Honduras and El Salvador). Still, the productivity of their labor is substantially larger than that of the average business. Sales per worker in El Salvador are 4.5 times the sales per worker in the average business, and in Guatemala, the average wage bill in digital businesses is 2.4 times the wage bill in the average business (Table 3). Similarly, high-tech manufacturing accounts for a small fraction of businesses in the region (2 percent in Honduras and El Salvador and only 0.5 percent in Guatemala), but the productivity of those firms is potentially large. Average sales per business in the industry are 2.5 times the sales of the average business in El Salvador and almost 9 times the sales of the average business in Guatemala.

Sales per firm and sales per worker are relative to the average plant in the data.       b. In Guatemala, the fraction of employment is the fraction of the total wage bill (because employment per plant is not available), and sales per worker       corresponds to the relative wage bill.    In the data, fewer women own businesses in the digital sector and in high-tech manufacturing relative to other industries. In El Salvador, 27 percent of businesses in digital technologies are owned by women, compared to the average of 31 percent across industries in the data. In Guatemala, 23 percent of businesses in digital technologies and 23 percent of businesses in high-tech manufacturing are owned by women, compared to the average across industries of 37 percent in the data. Moreover, whereas women account for 35 percent of the employment in the data in El Salvador, the fraction of women employees in high-tech manufacturing is only 25 percent.  The digital sector in the region seems to exhibit more dynamism relative to businesses in other economic activities. The data for El Salvador contains identifiers that track the business over time and help examine the flows of formal businesses in and out of the economy. On average, 6.5 percent of formal digital businesses in El Salvador will exit, and 7.4 percent of digital businesses will enter in a given year (Figure 11). Moreover, digital enterprises exit at a faster rate relative to other industries (6.5 vs. 5.1), but they also enter at a relatively faster pace (7.4 vs. 6.1). Digital enterprises that survived between 2014 and 2018 in El Salvador became significantly more productive—sales per     26       EN T R EP R EN EU R S H I P ECO S Y S T EM S I N CEN T R A L A M ER I C A hour worked in surviving digital businesses increased               per digital business high-potential ecosystems in El by 43 percent in the 5-year period (Figure 12), whereas             Salvador average USD 1.8 million per year, and only productivity in surviving businesses in other industries            around 183,000 in Guatemala and 21,500 in Honduras. seems to have remained relatively the same.

A SUMMARY OF HIGH-POTENTIAL LOCAL ECOSYSTEMS IN CENTRAL AMERICA High-potential ecosystems, in general, grow near capital cities in Central America. High-potential businesses in Guatemala mainly agglomerate in the Guatemala and Escuintla departments (Table 6). In El Salvador, they mainly agglomerate in San Salvador and La Libertad. In Honduras, Comayagua has high-potential agglomerations across several industries. Capital cities in Central America concentrate a larger share of the urban population than reported by official figures. Cities contribute more than 78 percent to the regional economy. Urban areas offer better jobs, higher wages, better access to safe drinking water, and shorter distances to health care facilities (Maria et al. 2017). Broadband penetration is lower in rural areas (ITU 2020), limiting the digital connectivity of firms.   Table 6.

The challenges include lack of awareness about what technologies exist, uncertainties about the return on investment in technologies, and lack of access to finance and talent to acquire and use technologies. Twenty-six percent of microenterprises and 23 percent of small firms report challenges with the cost of acquiring technologies, and 19 percent of microenterprises and 17 percent of small firms feel they lack adequate information on available technologies. Some 36 percent of midsize firms and 33 percent of large firms cite workforce skills gaps such as a lack of highly trained professionals in their countries as challenges to the use of technology (Figure 20).      46      A D O P T I O N O F T ECH N O LO G Y Figure 20.

Especially online seller-exporters are embracing digital payments such as cards and e-wallets (Figure 21) and have to an extent overcome their less digitized peers’ concerns about payment fraud. Less digitized sellers that do not yet have online stores or presence on marketplaces worry about the security of e-wallets and mobile payments, suggesting a need for greater awareness building for firms about digital transactions. Also, high commissions are an obstacle for e-payments.    Figure 21.

Another challenge that firms perceive is a need for support. Over three-quarters of firms across size categories learn about technologies from national and international technology suppliers. Although technology providers are supplying technical assistance to adopt their technologies, companies in all countries need further support. So far, over 50 percent of micro and small firms across all countries of Central America have gained technical assistance to adopt technologies from technology providers. However, a fifth or fewer have secured further technical assistance from their governments. Over 40 percent of micro and small firms in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama, and over 50 percent of micro and small firms in Guatemala and Nicaragua call for training and education to be better placed to adopt new technologies, and over a third call for support in identifying new technologies. Large firms across all six countries have these same needs for additional support.      48      A D O P T I O N O F T ECH N O LO G Y 5.3.

THE CASE OF THINK DIGITAL ACADEMY        A young Honduran couple founded Think Digital Academy in 2012 to provide digital education for small       and medium companies. Initially, the company operated as a franchise of the Digital Marketing Institute,       but they now create their own content adapted to the needs and growing demand of the Central       American market. Think Digital has taught more than 250 courses on digital commerce topics including       digital strategy, social media communication, political marketing, and digital transformation mindset.       The demand for international expertise has led the company to pursue partnerships with organizations       such as HubSpot, Google, and other global providers of digital education. Their primary clients are       commercial banks, the Honduran Tourism Institute, and enterprise development programs. Serving       clients with a regional presence has allowed Think Digital to grow its markets regionally by delivering       content through a digital platform. The main obstacle faced by Think Digital Academy has been the       lack of trust in digital service providers in Honduras. Another obstacle faced by Think Digital Academy       has been the lack of capital to continue expanding its services. It wasn’t until 2019 that Think Digital       obtained seed capital from a private investor who believed in their business model. This capital allowed       the company to standardize its operation, improve the content of its courses, expand marketing, and       upgrade classroom infrastructure (physical and digital). COVID-19 increased demand for digital skills and       digital marketing services, and Think Digital adapted its systems to deliver online courses and expanded       its outreach beyond Tegucigalpa, the capital city. The challenge during this period was to maintain       working capital due to the difficulties that MSME clients had with paying during the pandemic.      52       A D O P T I O N O F T ECH N O LO G Y start-ups in the process of linking and selling their                 report the use of advanced technologies such as ideas to capture private equity.

THE CASE OF HUGO TECHNOLOGIES–REGIONAL EXPANSION                           THROUGH GLOBAL VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTORS    Founded in 2017 by three Salvadoran technology entrepreneurs, Hugo App developed a mobile application for   food delivery that has reached over one million downloads in El Salvador and is expanding to other countries   in the region. By 2020, Hugo had become the first Central American “unicorn,” reaching over USD 50 million   in sales and valued at over USD one billion. Hugo connects food services and consumers through its mobile   application, allowing for digital payments, efficient logistics, and tracking for home and office deliveries.   Its founders had technology and financial backgrounds and business networks that allowed them to raise   capital from international technology investors to fund regional expansion. Private investors have provided   not only funds but also their expertise and strategic vision to adapt the business model to Central American   markets. Despite its remarkable growth, which accelerated during COVID-19, Hugo App still encounters   barriers to expanding its markets and operations. One of the biggest hurdles is the lack of streamlined   payment processing platforms that integrate all services in the region. The processes are still cumbersome.   The lack of digital economy regulations does not provide sufficient certainty and transparency. It keeps   large global technology and financial innovation providers from entering the region, which could enable a   smoother transition to the digitalization of payments. Finding the right talent—with technology skills and   an entrepreneurial mindset—has also been a challenge. Yet, the rapid growth of digital delivery platforms in   the region has become an increasingly important source of employment for young software developers and   digital markets, as well as for less-skilled workers such as motorcycle drivers.

Twenty-six percent and an online survey firm proprietary panel of                 are micro-enterprises with 1-4 employees, 22 percent respondents. The online survey process differs from              are small firms with 5-19 employees, 23 percent a traditional survey process in which the researcher             are midsize firms with 20-99 employees, and the draws up a sample frame of firms in a country and                remaining 28 percent are large firms (100 or more then randomly selects firms from it for what are                 employees) (Figure D.1). The largest samples are from typically phone interviews. The online survey method             Guatemala and El Salvador and from the financial is scalable and is considerably more cost-effective than         services and food processing sectors (Figure D.2).

The              areas (Figure D.5). method also allowed more easily reaching firms that were not at their physical offices and by their phones due to COVID-19.  There are some tradeoffs between online and traditional sampling methods. Online surveys inherently capture firms that are at least to an extent digitized so they can take the survey online and have self-selected to take a survey about the use of technology (thus likely going in knowing something about technology use). Hence, the sample, to an extent, over-represents firms that are more technology-intensive (and export-oriented, larger, and better performing). However, from experience, this does not markedly alter the general patterns of firm performance and technology adoption from what they are in a CATI survey drawn from a sampling frame.  The survey used several measures to ensure quality. The survey tracked the quality of responses in real-time, as respondents took the survey, through embedded questions detecting the survey takers’ emotional state and through fingerprinting that combines Internet protocol (IP) address, device type, screen size, and cookies to ensure only unique panelists enter the survey. It maintains a fraud score on each respondent based on historical completions (completion time as a percentage of the stated length of the survey + any flagged poor completes) and bans those that breach a certain level; the company also uses invisible ReCaptcha to defend against bots.

Technology use is highly correlated with firm size. Midsize and large firms are often better placed than micro and small firms to cover the fixed costs of technology adoption—including high-quality Internet, which enables the use of other technologies—and to acquire new staff capabilities to use technologies. Significant majorities of the micro and small firms use only the more basic technologies such as 4G mobile connections, social media, and video and messaging apps to get online, interact with customers, and make decisions (Figure D.6). A more substantial share—a quarter to a third, depending on the technology—of midsize and large firms have already started to use broadband, online stores and marketplaces, and specialized software to manage their customer relationships and operations; some have even ventured to use AI. Overall, the majority of firms of all sizes have yet to use the more sophisticated technologies such as AI, virtual reality, blockchain, or even e-commerce. This suggests that there are in Central America great opportunities for efficiency gains through the adoption of technology.    Figure D.6.

A higher share of firms in services sectors—BPO and financial services—use technologies than do firms in the more traditional export sectors like agriculture and light manufacturing (Table D.1). Firms in services sectors also perceive themselves as using technologies more intensively; for example, midsize and large BPO and financial services firms rate the intensity of their technology use above 9 points on a 10 point scale in such areas as human resources, quality control, and sales and marketing, while midsize and large agricultural firms rate their technology use at 7.5 points out of 10. Smaller firms rate their technology use lower, especially in production or inventory management activities (Figure D.9 and Figure D.10). Comparable male- and female-led firms, however, have strikingly similar technology adoption rates and sequences (Figure D.11).    Table D.1.

Robust digital capabilities and the use of online sales channels may help firms export and grow. However, many firms in Central America are still not using technologies intensively in their operations. This is not due to a lack of interest or understanding that technologies matter. Asked about the technologies that will transform their industries in the next decade, firms across sectors highlighted e-commerce, financial technologies, automation, and robotics (Figure D.15). However, the surveyed firms also cited a lack of knowledge about the various available technologies, concerns about the return on investment in technologies, and financing gaps as obstacles to the adoption of new technologies (Figure D.16). This may point to the need for public-private partnerships to enable firms to learn about and test technologies. So far, firms across the region have received technical assistance to apply technologies, especially from technology providers and associations (Figure D.17 and Figure D.18). Firms across size categories and countries call for more training about technologies and support for identifying the right technologies (Figure D.19 and Figure D.20).

Central American firms are hiring in-house technical capabilities to leverage and build on new technologies, such as engineers and programmers (Figure D.21). However, especially micro and small firms struggle to pay wages commanded by skilled applicants, while larger firms cite workforce skills gaps as a leading challenge to hire talent (Figure D.22).

Especially online seller-exporters are embracing digital payments such as cards and e-wallets (Figure D.27) and have, to an extent, overcome their less digitized peers’ concerns about payment fraud. Less digitized sellers that do not yet have online stores or presence on marketplaces worry about the security of e-wallets and mobile payments, suggesting a need for greater awareness-building for firms about digital transactions (Figure D.28).

This survey leveraged online survey methods                                       The survey used several measures to ensure quality. and an online survey firm proprietary panel of                                  The survey tracked the quality of responses in real-time, respondents. The online survey process differs from                               as respondents took the survey, through embedded a traditional survey process in which the researcher                              questions detecting the survey takers’ emotional draws up a sample frame of firms in a country and                                 state and through fingerprinting that combines IP then randomly selects firms from it for what are                                  address, device type, screen size, and cookies to ensure typically phone interviews. The online survey method                              only unique panelists enter the survey. It maintains is scalable and is considerably more cost-effective                               a fraud score on each respondent based on historical than a phone interview or CATI. Prior attempts at                                 completions (completion time as a percentage of combinations of CATIs based on a sample frame and                                 the stated length of the survey + any flagged poor scalable online surveys have resulted in strikingly similar                       completes) and bans those that breach a certain level; patterns in firms’ performance between the two sets                               the company also uses invisible ReCaptcha to defend (when comparing firms of the same size, sector, and                               against bots. geography).

Online surveys                                      percent are small firms with 5–19 employees, 24 percent inherently capture firms that are at least to an extent                           are midsize firms with 20–99 employees, and the digitized so they can take the survey online and                                  remaining 17 percent are large firms with more than have self-selected to take a survey about the use of                              100 employees but fewer than 499 employees (Figure technology (thus likely going in knowing something                                E.1).

However, a fifth, larger firms in particular, also use global services and their own developments (Figure E.8). Most firms across size categories learn about technologies from national technology suppliers; large firms also consult international suppliers and public programs (Figure E.9). To penetrate international markets, export-driven firms have used export promotion agencies and business associations for advice; non-exporters have mostly not received (or sought) assistance (Figure E.10).

MAIN CHALLENGES TO THE PROVISION OF DIGITAL SERVICES Firms see business registration processes, taxes, and concerns around intellectual property protections and cybersecurity as the main challenges for the use of digital services in their countries. (See Figure E.12.) They perceive high competition and limited scale of markets as constraints on efforts to scale and expand to new markets (Figure E.13).
