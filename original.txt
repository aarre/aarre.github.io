opportunity entrepreneurs˛Š˛in their considerations of ﬁentrepre neurshipﬂ  This phenomenon of bundling entrepreneurship under the generalist label of MSMEs is not exclusive  to Romania and is observed in other countries However it is not always helpful from a policy perspective At the  request of the Romanian ecosystem stakeholders this report focuses on strengthening the policies programs  and institutions essential for promoting growthoriented startups particularly involving technology or digital ˜rms  Our analysis of Romania™s current policy mix demonstrates that policymakers do not clearly distinguish  between startups and small and medium enterprises SMEs and thus the former remain underserved despite  their promise  Startups have many unique characteristics that distinguish them from other ˜rms and SMEs they  are typically young highly innovative work with emerging technology in nascent sectors and are often still trying  to establish a scalable business model There are fundamental differences between a young startup attempting to  scale within a new industry and an old SME with little growth ambition in a traditional sector even though they may  be the same size their core characteristics and the resources on which they draw will be quite distinct For exam ple the high technical risk or market risk of many startups means that risk ˜nance such as seed or venture capital  is often appropriate but these will not be interested in established ˜rms with no growth ambition  For these rea sons startups are best considered as a specialist subset of SMEs with particular needs and hence requiring spe ci˚c policies programs and instruments  See table 01 below for a sidebyside comparison of startups vs SMEs On the cusp of the new European programming period Romania has a major opportunity to recalibrate its  approach to innovation and entrepreneurship policy  The EU™s Recovery and Resilience Facility makes some •29  billion available in loans and grants

Ecosystems in Romaniaﬂ  Report According to the European Innovation Scoreboard Romania is a laggard in terms of its innovation and entrepre neurship performance  Romania™s innovation performance is also a critical factor when measuring the strength of  its entrepreneurship ecosystem On some measures the gap between Romania™s performance and the rest of the  European Union EU has widened over the past decade This review is therefore intended to support Romania in  developing and implementing a set of policies that improve the country™s innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem Romania performs poorly on STI visavis its European peers  Innovation is a key driver of growth and productiv ity However according to the EC™s European Innovation Scoreboard EIS 2021 Šan index intended to measure

neurship policies albeit with some improvement in conditions since 2018 see ˜gure 02 below Although ˜rm entry levels are relatively high the quality of Romanian ˜rms at entry remains an issue with

promote knowledge transfer between successful entrepreneurs and  nascent startups While ˜rm entry itself is not a barrier quality of ˜rms at entry is a concern due to low levels of  innovation and scaling up suggesting that there are barriers in the Romanian ecosystem that are preventing ˜rms  from achieving desirable outcomes Skilled talent whether as founders or workers in highgrowth ˜rms contributes to highquality ˜rms at entry  and scale up  Romania has a high proportion of science technology engineering and mathematics STEM grad uates but this is not translating into a high share of RD personnel in businesses and many employers see the  lowquality skills developed by the graduates to be a challenge Although STEM training may be necessary for pro ducing RD personnel data suggest that it is insuf˜cient One potential explanation for the gap may be ﬁbrain  drainﬂ Gavriloaia 2020 In 2017 a signi˜cantly larger share of Romanians with a doctorate masters or college  degree were living in a state different than the one in which they were born compared to 2008 Eurostat 2022  The differences amount to 144 percent between 2017 and 2008 Additionally employment is a dominant motive  among Romanian emigrants OECD 2019b While Romania has the ˜fth largest diaspora group in the world and  this is rapidly growing this possibly signals continuous concerns about viable domestic employment opportunities Improvement in entrepreneurship quality will also require more market opportunities for young and small  businesses both domestically and abroad  Barriers are preventing smaller ˜rms from participating in public  procurement Public sector can create an important market for many startups and play a role in stimulating inno vation While recent reforms have improved awareness current public procurement processes and platforms are  still perceived as dif˜cult to access for startups and other small ˜rms According to the most recent data avail able 2019 SMEs bid on 35 percent of public procurement contracts but are awarded only 5 percent of them  Regarding access to external markets Romania has fewer exporters than peer countries and uses a smaller pro portion of imports in its exports Only 17 percent of Romanian ˜rms export more than 1 percent of their sales  compared to 29 percent of Slovakian ˜rms The use of ecommerce remains low but uptake of ecommerce  platforms has accelerated during the COVID19 pandemic Romania saw the share of ˜rms selling online rise to  19 percent in 2020 from 9 percent in 2018 However there remains vast unrealized potential less than 20 per cent of ˜rms received even 1 percent of their revenue via online sales  Access to ˜nance for startups and innovative ˜rms remains a challenge  Romanian public sector ˜nancing  mechanisms are not tailored for small ˜rms and startups because they tend to favor postrevenue ˜rms which  may have the effect of supporting incumbents over new entrants Moreover equity and debt ˜nancing for research  and development remain below the EU average European Commission 2017 Romania™s regulatory environment is not optimized for entrepreneurs and startups  This includes reforms to  Romania™s company formation process supporting distressed businesses improving the ease of exiting a busi ness investing into startups and intellectual property IP protections This is because policymakers do not clearly  distinguish between startups and SMEs and thus the former remain underserved by the existing regulatory envi ronment and policy mix  Though entrepreneurship is accorded reasonably high social status increasingly considered a desirable career  choice and widely promoted by the media Romania ranks low on indicators of social capital  Low social capital  which has been observed by the EU European Commission 2017 is also evident in the ecosystem where stake holders reported siloed networks and limited collaboration and connectedness between stakeholders reinforcing  the perception of ecosystem fragmentation There also appears to be a limited ﬁgive backﬂ mentality in Romania ﬁIntangibleﬂ entrepreneurial factors such as risk appetite attitudes towards entrepreneurship and cultural  mindset are di˝cult to shift though policymakers can ensure regulatory frameworks create an enabling envi ronment for startups and entrepreneurs to start scale up andor exit  Romanian authorities have introduced  numerous policy instruments to support innovation and entrepreneurship These ought to be revisited with the  view to con˜rm to what extent they support the

Development Agency NE RDA two additional Policy Recommendations are included  within ﬁScale up through exportsﬂ and ﬁImplementing Startup Visasﬂ The team recommends additional analysis  to inform a ﬁTransform Public Procurementﬂ recommendation that improves domestic market access for startups  Part One Part One provides an analysis of Romania™s STI policy instruments related to entrepreneurship  Innovation  and entrepreneurship are key drivers of growth and productivity An appropriate and effective portfolio of policy  instruments relevant to innovation and entrepreneurship is thus important in driving economic growth creating  highquality jobs and increasing living standards all of which are important objectives for Romania as it continues  to advance its development This analysis leverages the ˜rst two modules of the World Bank™s Public Expenditure  Review PER framework Correa 2014 Cirera and Maloney 2017  Part One is composed of two sections an analysis of the current policy mix followed by a closer examination of the  functioning of selected Romanian STI support programs  The ˜rst section the ﬁpolicy mix analysisﬂ examines the  numbers and expenditures of the portfolio of instruments with regard to their objectives types of intervention bene˜ ciaries and so on The second section the ﬁfunctional analysisﬂ assesses the functionality and governance of selected  Romanian STI support programs This exercise has its limitations because it was based on incomplete program data a  limited number of interviews and secondary research undertaken between late2020 and mid2021 and had to make  several assumptions However it follows closely the methodology of the ˜rst two stages of the PER and provides reason able indications both on the relevance of the policy mix and program functionality This review did not cover instruments  managed by the European Investment Fund EIF or look in detail at the public funding of research IP regulations or  technology transfer Thus Part One indicates areas where additional data collection and analysis would be needed to  con˜rm some of the initial ˜ndings on STI presented in this report Nevertheless the analysis clearly identi˜es several  areas where there is scope for improvement Particularly it makes suggestions about reforms to the overall policy mix  and gaps in support as well as issues relating to the design implementation and overall governance of instruments Key Findings Policy Mix Analysis  The current portfolio of policies is highly concentrated  Signi˜cant resources are devoted to a few instruments  and a ‚long tail™ of much smaller instruments that are likely to be operating below their optimum scale Rationalizing  or scaling some of these smaller instruments ought to be considered Most instruments have multiple toplevel objectives  For example some instruments combine productivity  improvement objectives with job creation objectives This may suggest a lack of clarity in the design of instru ments Together with the large number of small instruments this suggests that few are likely to target important  objectives and some are likely to be ineffective  There are gaps in intermediatelevel objectives  We recommend the development of instruments that address  management practices linkages with foreign ˜rms and market access as a means of achieving toplevel objectives There are important gaps in support for entrepreneurs and earlystage startups  There is little specialization  among instruments focused on the private sector We recommend the development of more targeted instruments  for earlystage prepro˜t startups and individual entrepreneursŠas well as the intermediary organizations that  17 E XECUTIVE  S UMMARY support such startups such as incubators and accelerators Some ﬁentrepreneurshipﬂ instruments may reinforce  the role of incumbents rather than encourage the growth of innovative startups  Most instruments have multiple intervention mechanisms  Different mechanisms typically require different  capabilities that are not complementary and are rarely found in one agency or of˜ce at the same time We recom mend that instruments that invoke multiple mechanisms simultaneously be reviewed  Grants are the dominant intervention mechanism  This may be appropriate in a relatively underdeveloped inno vation and entrepreneurship ecosystem However it is important to remember that not every element of the eco system can necessarily be resolved through public money In Romania missing complementary aspects likely merit  inclusion of other kinds of ˜nancial instruments and technical assistance  Key Findings Functional Analysis Logic models are consistently weak  The analysis found a persistent weakness in the logic models or theories of  change of instruments Developing and articulating these models should enable better accounting of inputs and  activities by managing authorities MAs as well as improved targeting of the instrument It should also prompt  ideas for alternative instruments and mechanisms which would assist with rationalization of the portfolio and the  development of a wider range of mechanisms  Instruments™ budgets were often missized  This suggests that some rationalizationŠor expansion of the more  successful programsŠmay be warranted  Instrumentlevel evaluation needs to be improved  Evaluation is currently stronger at the Priority Axis level  Improved evaluation at the instrument level would also support rationalization of the portfolio by providing infor mation about which instruments should be scaled up and which may need to be discontinued Administrative burdens for many bene˜ciaries are still high  There has been a signi˜cant effort by managing  bodies to simplify the application processes for support schemes and reduce the bureaucracy for applicants  However there are still indications that these processes remain overly complex for applicants For example the  fact that startups and SMEs often need to hire consultants and advisors in order to apply for government support  schemes is an indicator that the application processes are overly complex Notably this may have the effect of  shifting support away from the earliest stage resourcescarce ˜rms where it is most needed Bureaucratic burdens for administrators are also signi˜cant  Auditing of instruments multiple times appears  to impose a signi˜cant burden on administrative teams Bureaucratic friction is likely to be increased by the struc ture of many instruments which have both an MA and a separate intermediate body IB this may be a necessary  condition of some European funding but is unlikely to be optimal  Policy Recommendations  Part Two presents evidence and stakeholderdriven policy recommendations separated into Notes for con sideration as inputs into Romania™s National Startup Ecosystem Strategy  These Notes will form the basis of a  comprehensive package of policies to be considered for implementation

ENTREPRENEURSHIP  PROGRAMS  23 CHAPTER 1     OVERVIEW   24 C HAPTER  1   O VERVIEW Comprehensive and targeted policy can help stimulate entrepreneurial activity giving rise to economic growth  innovation and job creation  An appropriately tailored portfolio of policy instruments can encourage and support  the needs of a given entrepreneurship ecosystem However poorly designed public instruments can displace or  inhibit private initiative and innovation It is therefore important to undertake periodic reviews of the policy mix spe ci˜c instruments its targets and recalibrate this based on the evolving needs of the entrepreneurship ecosystem Part One of this report reviews Romania™s instrument set in support of entrepreneurship  Entrepreneurship  support is a subset of the broader set of science technology and innovation STI instruments The report follows  the ˜rst two modules of the World Bank™s Public Expenditure Review PER methodology which is aimed at deter mining the quality of government measures to enhance the competitiveness of the country™s economy  The full PER in STI consists of four main components  They are 1 STI portfolio mapping and analysis of the pol icy mix 2 functional and governance analysis 3 ef˜ciency analysis and 4 effectiveness analysis The mod ular methodology was re˜ned in several analogous PER exercises in other European Union EU countries and  beyond including Bulgaria Croatia and Poland It was calibrated to support EU authorities throughout the lifecy cle of ˜nancial perspectives from planning through midterm program calibrations to postprogramming impact  evaluations When fully implemented the STI PER documents the quality of the state™s interventions in STI and its  ability to enable the achievement of the social economic and cultural objectives of the nation The complete PER  methodology with all its modules is illustrated in ˜gure 11 Correa 2014 Cirera and Maloney 2017  Part One Analysis of Romania™s Existing Policy Mix and Functionality includes the ˜rst two modules of the  fourstage PER  1 the policy mapping and policy mix analysis and 2 the functional and governance analysis  Due to data limitations the conclusions o˚ered within are preliminary yet indicative of reality  Some conclu sions are substantial enough to suggest potential policy improvements in the areas of entrepreneurship innova tion and research and development RD However owing both to limited data availability and access to public  program managers most ˜ndings need more indepth investigation to fully ascertain the public policy conse quences of what is observed This consideration is essential to keep in mind when interpreting the conclusions  presented at the end of this portion of the report FIGURE 11    Schematic of the PER Stages Source  World Bank Group Note  PER  Public Expenditure Review ROI  return on investment ˜˚˛˝˙˛ˆˇ˘    25 C HAPTER  1   O VERVIEW Romania™s science technology innovation and entrepreneurship system performs poorly with signi˜cant  opportunity for stronger public policy intervention  Innovation is a key driver of growth and productivity As pre sented in the Introduction Romania has the weakest innovation system within the EU as measured by the indi cators of the European Innovation Scoreboard EIS European Commission 2021 In fact performance declined  between 2012 and 2020 relative to the rest of the EU the innovation gap between Romania and other countries  widened It follows that there is signi˜cant room for improvement in Romania™s current STI policies On the current  trajectory the existing policies will be insuf˜cient to close the innovation gap between Romania and other EU states   11   DEFINITION OF ﬁINSTRUMENTﬂ The PER STI methodology distinguishes public policy ﬁinstrumentsﬂ by their causal mechanisms  The PER  focuses on speci˜c public interventions in STI The de˜nition of a public policy ﬁinstrumentﬂ is based on the causal  mechanism that the intervention invokes to produce the desired changes in the given area of     interest The de˜ni tion of instrument used here may differ from the nomenclature of the Romanian government The de˜nitions used  in the regulations serve to identify budget categories that allow a clear reference to the ˜scal order The de˜nition  used here is based on the need for the PER methodology to associate budget categories with effects on society  and the economy Doing so requires distinguishing instruments by means of the causal mechanism by which the  desired results are expected to occur Scholarships for postgraduate studies abroad are one example  In order to increase the population of highly  quali˜ed people with worldclass experience the state offers scholarships for postgraduate studies abroad for  national students The intervention a subsidy in the form of a scholarship in this case allows students to cover  the high costs of their studies In return the country receives the bene˜ts of the contributions of these graduates  when they return In this case the mechanism for granting scholarships with the transfer of resources involved  is an instrument of the state™s STI policy Its implementation operates under the assumption that the country will  not have the human resources in the necessary quantity and quality for its development unless it intervenes with  the scholarships and that these students will return to the country following their studies 26 CHAPTER 2     POLICY MIX ANALYSIS   27 C HAPTER  2   P OLICY  M IX  A NALYSIS   21   PURPOSE This section covers the ˜rst module of the PER of STI policy in Romania  It includes policy measures in the  areas of entrepreneurship as well as areas of innovation and research and development RD that are poten tially relevant for entrepreneurship This also allows policymakers to understand entrepreneurship with the back drop of the broader STI policy mix  The budget analysis examines the relationship between expenditures and objectives  In the budget analysis  of the policy mix the focus is on the relation of the expenditures in each instrument and the entire set of instru ments that is the ﬁpolicy mixﬂ with the patterns of objectives types of intervention bene˜ciaries and the fea tures of ˜rms in the case of instruments aimed at the private sector This analysis provides a baseline for the  interpretation of further stages of the PER in STI policy    22   METHOD The ˜rst step was to compile a list of relevant instruments and programs involving public resources  This list  explicitly included subnational regional national and supranational EC sources provided that the instrument  was at least partially administered within Romania and the recipients themselves were within Romania This long  list included several programs from the Programul Opera˝ional Competitivitate POC a 201420 program sup ported by the European Regional Development Fund ERDF and intended to increase competitiveness and eco nomic development by improving information and communication technologies ICT research and innovation the  Programul Opera˝ional Regional POR a regional development program in Romania also supported by the ERDF  whose purpose is the development of infrastructure and business environment the Programul Opera˝ional Capital  Uman POCU the European Program for the Competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises COSME and the  European Investment Bank EIB This stage did not however include block funding to universities and research  organizations for basic research nor did it include all European Investment Fund EIF funding  Programs were then ˜ltered for relevance  Having compiled the list of programs these were ˜ltered for their rel evance for entrepreneurship Only programs with direct or indirect relevance to entrepreneurship were included  Thus programs that supported private sector digitalization were retained for instance because some of these pro grams might bene˜t digital startups However programs relating only to digitalization of government were excluded Budget data was extracted from available documents and estimates are likely incomplete  This data was based on  publicly available documents concerning the relevant instruments as well as mySMIS a common data portal for many of  the Europeanfunded programs The data set was not complete with some programs having no identi˜able budget data  It is therefore important to note several caveats ˜rst data might be skewed by external reporting factors Second where  programs had no budget data identi˜able estimates were made based on past programs or other sources which might be  inaccurate Third some programs covered a wide range of activities including entrepreneurship in such cases the propor tion of spending that was relevant was estimated based on numbers reported by the managing authorities MAs at the oper ational program level Fourth some instruments targeted multiple analytical categories such as multiple ˜rm sizes or mul tiple objectives where this was the case the total budget of the instrument was divided equally between the components  Budgets were standardized over time  The years of implementation for instruments were standardized assum ing that the starting year was the year of the ˜rst call and that the end year was the projected end year with EU  funds running to 2023 as per regulations unless otherwise stated The total budget of the instrument was then  divided evenly by the number of years from the start year until the projected end year The resulting averages were  multiplied by the number of years passed since launch and summed up in the case of multiple calls Although we  recognize that the real spending pro˜le of many programs is unlikely to be spread uniformly in this way this aver age allows an approximate comparison of budgets for programs of different lengths We also recognize that in the  case of instruments with multiple calls there is an issue regarding overlapping calls the methodology may lead  us incorrectly to assume that a greater proportion of the budget is spent in years where calls overlap Conclusions should be considered carefully  Given the various caveats about the data and the process the  level of accuracy is not 100˙percent Therefore analysis and recommendations made within this report should be  treated with caution even though they tend to mirror reality  28 C HAPTER  2   P OLICY  M IX  A NALYSIS   23   FINDINGS    231   BUDGET The overall policy mix comprises some 50 instruments with a budget allocation over •37 billion  These ˜g ures relate to the total budget allocation including European funds but excluding EIF investments over the period  under consideration The available data for sources of funding shows that EU funding versus national funding is  received in approximately a ratio of 32 This includes national co˜nancing and private sector funds that may be  leveraged by public funding although this ratio should be interpreted cautiously because there are missing of˜ cial values for several national instruments A little over onequarter of the policy mix has entrepreneurship as its core objective  Thirteen of the 50 instru ments with a related total budget allocation of •949 million have entrepreneurship as an explicit goal The remain ing threequarters of the policy mix relate primarily to innovation  competitiveness RD or digitalization These  however may be considered indirectly relevant to entrepreneurship or the development of the broader ecosystem Standardizing STI budgets over time provides an estimated annual budget allocation of •577 million  As dis cussed above instruments vary in duration If one adjusts for this dividing each instrument™s allocated budget  over the instrument™s years of operation and then summing these the average total annual budget amounts to  •577 million Alternatively if one presumes that all spend will occur within the current sevenyear funding period  as used for EU instruments then the annual expenditure may instead be estimated at around •534 million This  assumes that the budget of each instrument is distributed equally over their years of operation It also assumes  that all instruments are operating concurrently which is representative of the most recent period under investi gation 2019Œ20 but not necessarily for earlier years  Low absorption means that this is likely an overestimation of actual expenditures  The fact that a budget has  been allocated does not mean that the amounts were actually spent or that the projects consummated It is com mon knowledge that Romania has very low absorption ratesŠthat is the proportion of budgets that are actually  spent in time This occurs for several reasons including a lack of suitable institutional capacity at various levels  Data from October 2020 indicates that this absorption rate was only 347 percent for programs administered by  the Human Capital Program POCU 318 percent for the Regional Operational Programme POR and as low as  265 percent for the Competitiveness Operational Programme POC In what follows we have typically referred  to the  allocated budget  because this better re˚ects governmental priorities However it should be noted that  the˙ actual  expenditure on innovation and entrepreneurship˙are likely much lower due to the low absorption rate  FIGURE 21   Distribution of Estimated STI Public Budget Allocation in Romania by Toplevel Objective  2014Œ20 in • Million and  Note  Policy mapping of 50 instruments 2014Œ20 of which 13 were

resources in a few instruments  The graph below illustrates the cumulative  annualized budget sorted from largest to smallest instrument It shows a signi˜cant concentration of allocated  ˜nancial resources in a few large instruments The three largest instrumentsŠone under the  Programul Ajutoare  de stat pentru ˚nan˛area proiectelor pentru investi˛ii  and two under the  Programul Opera˝ional Regional  PORŠ account for half of the annualized budget Threequarters of the total annualized expenditure is directed towards  roughly a quarter of the total number of instruments analyzed in this exercise A corollary of the high concentration of resources in a few instruments is that there are many small instru ments that may not have the scale necessary to have an impact even if they are well designed and imple mented  Although it is not unusual to ˜nd such a distribution of budgets   Š   a similar pattern is found in other coun tries   Š   it is important to recognize that at the individual instrument level the smaller instruments may represent  a disproportionately large administrative effort More than half the instruments in this set involve less than •5  million average annual expenditures    232   OBJECTIVES In terms of general objectives the pro˜le of the policy mix seems focused on developing the business eco system  Twentyone 21 instruments focus on productivity improvements 18 on new ventures and diversi˜cation  and 17 on skills and jobs Knowledge creation however  is represented by less than half the number of instru ments focusing on other objectives Furthermore there  are no entrepreneurship instruments focusing explicitly  on the role of startups in addressing environmental or  climate change objectives Most instruments focus on multiple general objec tives  Thirty of the 50 instruments in this set are focused  on two general objectives simultaneously The instru ments focused on social development and human cap ital objectives are the ones that most often share their  aim with another objective Fig 24 In other words  there are very few instruments that focus solely on these  objectives exclusively On the other hand about half the  instruments that focus on productivity do so exclusively  FIGURE 22   Cumulative Annualized Budget by Number of Instruments Source  World Bank Group FIGURE 23   Instruments by General TopLevel

considered  as  the intermediary route by which the general objective is to be achieved   For example an instrument might have  the ultimate goal of improving productivity and approach this via improving management practices or technol ogy adoption or something else Note that although some of the speci˜c objectives are likely to be more closely  linked with some of the general objectives than others they are not necessarily subsets of the general objectives The most common speci˜c objectives are technology transfer skills formation business environment improve ment and entrepreneurship but many instruments have multiple speci˜c objectives ˜gure 25  Between 15  and 20 instruments include one of the top four as their speci˜c objective On the other hand management prac tices linkages with foreign ˜rms and market access are addressed by very few instruments fewer than 5 for any  one of them  Many instruments have multiple speci˜c objectives and several instruments have four of them  Although skills  formation and technology transfer may seem to be the two most common objectives for instruments  none of the  instruments are strictly dedicated to these objectives   The lion™s share of the resource allocations around three˜fths of the total budget goes to two general objec tives productivity growth and diversi˜cationnew ventures  The other objectives re˚ect a small fraction of the  annualized expenditure Thus the distribution of expenditures by general objective reveals a signi˜cantly differ ent picture from the one produced by the number of instruments per objective About as many instruments are  dedicated to societal development and human capital as to productivity growth and diversi˜cationnew ventures  however the budget dedicated to the instruments focused on societal development and human capital is much  smaller than the budget dedicated to the instruments that focus on productivity and diversi˜cation  FIGURE 25   Instruments by

INTERVENTIONS Grants including matching grants are the preferred method of intervention  Fortythree of the 50 instruments  are in this category ˜gure 29 The type of intervention represented by each instrument is an important feature  of public policy and the combination of types of inter vention re˚ects the multiple causal mechanisms that  the government™s strategy invokes to obtain the de sired STI results if the distribution by objectives indi cates  what  public authorities want to achieve the dis tribution by types of intervention indicates  how  they are  acting See appendix B for a more complete descrip tion of these classi˜cations  Several instruments use more than one intervention  mechanism simultaneously  In some cases the use of  multiple intervention mechanisms may be associated  with the fact that several instruments are centers or or ganizations that contain multiple types of intervention  within them However this is not the case for all instru ments other instruments are not centers or organiza tions but nevertheless have multiple intervention mecha nisms This pattern of multiple intervention mechanisms  per instrument is consistent with that observed in oth er less developed innovation systems  For example the largest instrument invokes three di˚erent intervention mechanisms vouchers tax incentives  and infrastructure  These are not easy to manage together given the different assumptions in each Vouchers are  instruments to purchase RD services performed by another entity selected by the bene˜ciary Tax incentives apply  to the bene˜ciaries for

objectives This case is less problematic but the report ing confuses the level at which the intervention operates  The only valid mechanism in this case is the grant Net working and training for example are not carried out by  a government agency It could be the case that the grant  to set up incubators is provided in combination with train ing networking and business services by a government  agency In that case the intervention would be a portfo lio and would have to be designed as such The evidence  does not suggest this is the case for this intervention Grants also dominate the budget

universities and research institutes receive a smaller proportion of resources given the number of instruments  It should be noted that there are other funding instruments for universities that were

covers the second stage of the PER of STI policy in Romania  It aims to assess the functionality  and governance of selected Romanian STI support programs thus providing evidencebased recommendations  for improving the design implementation and governance of the country™s STI portfolio The analysis assesses  the  functionality  rather than the impact of STI support instruments functionality here refers to the quality of  processes involved in creating and implementing each instrument including the design implementation ME  systems human resources and governance the instrument™s integration and interactions with other programs  institutions and regulations    32   METHOD The methodology for the analysis is based on a comprehensive analytical framework benchmarked to interna tional best practices  The analytical framework developed by the World Bank scores support programs along a  total of 30 variables 14 related to program design 12 related to implementation and 4 related to program gov ernance ˜gure 31 See  Annex B Instruments Examined  for the overview of examined instruments See  Annex  C Detailed Findings of the Functional Analysis  for more detailed ˜ndings from the Functional Analysis including  the approach for the data classi˜cation The functionality of each program is scored on a scale of 1 to 5 for each  variable where 5 denotes international best practice A score of 3 should not necessarily be interpreted as ‚aver age™ but as a functional aspect that is satisfactory but has room for improvement  FIGURE 31   Summary of Functional Analysis Indicators

effective innovation policies have been met in three key areas Ł   Design  Public interventions must be designed through a process covered by the rule of law and consist ent with general national or regional goals for research and innovation They must be properly justi˜ed and  address real problems avoiding the trap of addressing false failures This justi˜cation can also help avoid  capture of public resources by certain vested bene˜ciaries Once a system failure is identi˜ed policy mak ers should consider the full range of alternative intervention designs rather than simply copying existing pro grams By design interventions should follow a clear wellarticulated logic model that helps depict the shared  relationships and causal linkages between program inputs activities outputs and outcomes and logically  connect them to higherlevel strategic objectives Logic models should de˜ne indicators for inputs activities  outputs and outcomes that allow for ME of program performance Ł   Implementation  Processes for administering the program including application selection and reporting  should be clear and transparent and knowledge management systems should be in place to allow for sys tematic learning and improvement of the instrument during implementation Implementing agencies must  have adequate human resources and organizational structures to administer the program and staff should  have training opportunities and incentives that are relevant to program performance rather than generic to  public administration staff Internal and external ME of the instrument should take place and critically  evaluation results should be used to improve and adapt the program Ł   Governance  Coordination mechanisms should be in place to minimize overlap and enhance complementa rities between the instrument and other programs and agencies Implementing staff should also be aware  of external laws and regulations that can inhibit the implementation of the instrument and should be proac tive in taking steps to adapt for optimal operation of the instrument This analysis covers nine instruments supporting STI covering the period 2014 to 2023  Together these nine  instruments represent around •14 billion of the •37 billion of the total allocated funding around 37 percent  However many of the remaining set of 50 instruments fall under the same operational programs and ministries  and so will share some similar characteristics The key agencies and ministries interviewed which included the  Ministry of EU Funds and Investments the Ministry of Public Works Development and Public Administration and  the Ministry of Finance were responsible for the administration of the bulk of the instruments in the policy mix  instruments totaling •32 billion of the •37 billion and in many cases con˜rmed that other instruments were  designed and operated in similar fashion to those ones under analysis Thus although the functional analysis only  examined nine instruments there is reason to believe that this sample re˚ects the wider policy mix Nevertheless  the observations and conclusions from this analysis should be viewed as indicative of possible issues but not nec essarily conclusive as the small sample may not capture many potential areas of interest regarding practices that  affect the functionality of the overall set of STI policies The analysis was based on semistructured interviews  Interviews were held with key staff from the instruments  concerned each scored by a team composed of a minimum of three interviewers in order to try to minimize inter viewer bias On occasion multiple interviews were held for one instrument either because administration of an  instrument was split across organizations or because clari˜cation was needed It is important to note that the  National Authorities were not the primary client of this project and agreed to participate at the request of regional  authorities As a result the project did not have the internal motivation to connect with the project™s potential as  an opportunity for learning and continuous improvement Therefore the interviews were not as informative and  lacked the detailed narratives about organizational culture and tacit knowledge that was made available for the  functional analysis in other countries Some information was gleaned from reports by stakeholders rather than  the program managers themselves However the perception of outsiders cannot substitute for direct reports from  the managers themselves 38 C HAPTER  3   F UNCTIONAL  A NALYSIS   33   OVERVIEW OF FINDINGS Romania™s scores show some areas that are ripe for improvement  Some scores are higher than others In addi tion there is signi˜cant variation within indicators when considering the average scores in comparison to the max imum and minimum score for each indicator across the set of instruments included in the analysis We discuss  design implementation governance and issues related to variation Several of the areas show in˙uence from EU regulations  In general EU regulations appear to have had a positive  impact on functionality including in the program origins closure ME and coordination mechanisms However  we also noted areas where unclear or inadequate EU rules may have contributed to low scores particularly in the  use of logic models and the consideration of alternative instruments We suggest that it would help Romanian  authorities to differentiate more clearly between  compliance  and  functionality  these are not the same and sev eral instruments appeared to demonstrate a focus on the former at the expense of the latter    331   DESIGN Among the design indicators those related to the use of logic models accounting of inputs and activities  and the proper identi˜cation and measurement of outcomes deserve special attention  The areas of specif ic opportunity for improvement are re˚ected in the indicators with lower scores in ˜gure 32 The problem areas  have average scores below 3 the middle of the range or point of indifference The high average score for program  origin is also noticeable The remaining indicators have average scores slightly above 3 re˚ecting better practic es but with room for improvement The existence and  application of a logic model and the proper cataloging  of inputs and activities are two areas of concern The  lower scores of these indicators reveal a possible dis connect between the destination of the expenditures of  the instrument and the administrative costs incurred to  implement it given that cataloging of inputs and activi ties relates directly to the ability to estimate such costs  The quality of the de˜nition of objectives of the instru ment and the determination of outcomes and impacts  are other areas of concern For example objectives are  often selfreferential statements to the need for the in strument In other words in the case of funding instru ments the objective of an instrument is to provide fund ing in a certain area because there is little funding or  support in that area This sort of statement of objec tives is circular and begs the question of why the gov ernment must support it and what outcomes are expect ed from providing it The program origin has good practices in general which is explained by the processes required by the opera tional programmes OPs of the EU framework  These processes are highly formalized requiring documentation  and good rationales for inclusion of instruments in their funding schemes This avoids pitfalls related to arbitrary  reasons imitation or undue in˚uences However it is possible that this origin has also affected deeper consider ation of some other design features more than once interviewees commented that design of an instrument had  been determined or heavily in˚uenced by the European Commission EC rather than having been designed by  the Romanian authority itself following a consideration of various alternatives  The relatively high average score for inclusion of an ME system deserves further scrutiny  The score for this indi cator is mainly due to the existence of a centralized data gathering and reporting system which offers good infra structure for data and information management when it comes to ME However it is well known from other coun tries that such centralized systems are often tailored to general government investments and expenditures and so  do not include speci˜c items that are tailored to science technology and innovation policies  FIGURE 32   Average Scores for Design indicators Source  World Bank Group ˜ ˚ ˛ ˝ ˙ ˆ 39 C HAPTER  3   F UNCTIONAL  A NALYSIS Moreover the fact that both objectives and outcomes are not as good raises the question of how the sys tem operates in relation to the instrument implementation  Most of the responses received from the interviews  revealed that program managers did not distinguish the objectives inputs activities outputs and outcomes of  projects from the policy or instrument and it appeared that ME was often weaker at the instrument level than  at the program level or Priority Axis level Supported projects do not automatically aggregate to successful gov ernment interventions and so the outcomes of these instruments may not be good enough to in˚uence the sys tem even if each individual project within it has good results Therefore the design of the ME system may not  be what the instrument really needs We therefore recommend that this aspect of functionality is examined in  closer detail in the future    332   IMPLEMENTATION Among the implementation indicators eligibility and selection criteria budgets and incentives associated  with sta˚ performance are of concern  The implementation indicators related to eligibility budget staff perfor mance incentives and process monitoring have lower average scores Scores on these indicators fall below the  midrange of the scale as shown in ˜gure 33 below The application process re˚ects the side of the bene˜ciar ies in relation to submitting proposals and expecting  a decision in a timely manner There is some variety  across instruments but the division of labor in process ing applications with different roles given to different  entities ˜nancial and technical assessments for exam ple and some repetition in veri˜cation processes limit  timely responses  The budget indicator average score is relatively low  This re˚ects the dif˜culties that many instruments have  in executing it and not having a good understanding of  the demand for the speci˜c focus in the design of the  solicitations There were problems with both undershoot  and overshoot suggesting that instrument budgets are  not designed commensurate with instrument goals Romanian STI instruments are not hiring specialized  human resources connecting performance assess ment with program goals or monitoring for continuous  improvement  Most of the reporting on management  and staf˜ng indicated a degree of satisfaction with the  structure and availability of human resources However  the scores may overestimate the actual situation because it was common to hear during interviews that the public  service system operated under general rules and the managers did not think much of the relation between those  and the speci˜cs of the STI policies under study There is consensus in developed nations and the analytical liter ature on management of public support for RD and innovation that specialized human resources are necessary  with ˚exible entrepreneurial approaches to public management In this vein the performance assessment of staff  was not related to the content of the instruments This disconnect between performance assessment and program  goals occurs in other areas and is the general established process of public service Similarly the processes of  public management were not monitored for continuous improvement which is re˚ected in its lower average score  Implementation capacity requires further examination  We suspect that implementing capacity is lacking in Romania  as it is in neighboring countries for which functional analyses were also conducted Reasons to suspect that this may be  a constraint include the fact that some instruments did not seem to have enough skilled staff nor many opportunities  for improving their own staff This is reinforced by evidence from other World bank projects such as the ﬁSupporting  Innovation in Romania™s CatchingUp Regionsﬂ project as well as from ecosystem stakeholders Regrettably we were  unable to examine this in detail as our research did not allow direct observation of the working conditions nor was  the Romanian Government the ultimate client However we suggest that it warrants closer attention  FIGURE 33   Average Scores for Implementation  indicators Source  World Bank Group Note  ME  monitoring and evaluation ˜ ˚ ˛ ˝ ˙ ˆ 40 C HAPTER  3   F UNCTIONAL  A NALYSIS Many instruments were structured in a way that is likely to increase administrative costs  It is notable that  many instruments were structured in a way that involved both an MA and an intermediate body IB working in  coordination This was generally reported as working satisfactorily with clearly de˜ned responsibilities However  from a management theory perspective as well as from practical experience of similar situations in other coun tries it seems unavoidable that this structure will introduce some additional friction and costs For example in  case adjustments are needed during instrument implementation or impediments arise due to application of reg ulations or EC rules this arrangement might call for consultations and lengthy negotiations Situations such as  these were found in all other countries in the region where a functional analysis was conducted Bulgaria Croatia  and Poland A follow up of this analysis may be necessary to assess the proper operation of this division of labor  to understand whether the functionality of any instruments is affected    333   GOVERNANCE The analysis found relatively good internal and external coordination mechanisms coordination with programs  within the agency and with other agencies  as shown in ˜gure 34 below This is partly because programs within  the EC™s ‚priority axes™ have some coordination mech anisms built in However in some cases those mecha nisms could be utilized further to provide more strategic  perspectives on the related programs  The functional analysis also found several instanc es of entrepreneurship programs being constrained  by European State Aid rules  This was primarily due to  the State Aid rules not being welladjusted to the inno vation support by government interventions However  these rules are not easy to change and managers were  typically aware of these rules and their constraints but  cannot change or mitigate their effect    334   EVIDENCE FROM VARIATION  There is signi˜cant variation in the scores across indicators for this set of instruments indicating opportu nities for learning within Romania  Variation refers to how well policy instruments scored against the bestcase  scenario according to global practice Higher scores are coded in green average scores are coded in yellow and  lower scores are coded in red The combined radar graphs in ˜gure 35 illustrate variance of public instruments  This chart shows the maximum and minimum scores for each indicator in addition to the average score for each  indicator Some indicators have relatively high scores in at least one instrument even when the average is quite  low Conversely several indicators have the lowest possible score as well This indicates that there is potential for  internal learning from the examples of better practices in some of the instruments  Comparing scores and variability reveals system wide strengths needs for system wide improvements and  opportunities for learning from within  Another view of the variation of scores across programs is presented  in ˜gure 36 below which plots the average score per indicator on the horizontal axis and the standard devia tion on the vertical axis indicators that fall in the upper two quadrants those with high standard deviations are  areas within the set of policies with a high potential for internal learning as there are programs in these areas  with both high scores good practices and low scores poor practices Variables that fall in the upper left quad rant show great variation in scores but lower averages so learning opportunities may be the greatest in these  areas Variables in the bottom left quadrant are those with both low scores and low standard deviation indi cating the need for systemwide improvement with few if any examples of good practices in this set of policies  Indicators in the bottom right quadrant are those with high scores and low standard deviation indicating areas  of systemwide strength  FIGURE 34   Average Score for Governance  Indicators Source  World Bank Group 0 1 2 3 4 5 Program relationship Jurisdictions internal Institutions

3   F UNCTIONAL  A NALYSIS There are several indicators that seem to need systematic improvement  These indicators in the lower left  quadrant are design indicators associated with the use of logic models inputs and activities of the instrument  rather than supported projects and the matter of setting instrument objectives and de˜nition of speci˜c out comes and impacts There is also an implementation indicator in this group namely the budget that seems also  to be a systemic issue  There are signi˜cant opportunities for learning including from internal capabilities  The indicators in the  upper left quadrant where there are signi˜cant opportunities for learning including from internal capabilities  include the consideration of an alternative instrument for the same objective on the design side the eligibility  criteria and application information and process monitoring on the implementation side and the effect of rules  from other jurisdictions  Mixed indicators and strengths  There are many indicators in the upper right quadrant that have averages above  the midpoint but also rather high variance indicating that there are cases with poorer practices in those areas as  well Finally there are a few indicators that show good practices systematically shown in the lower right quadrant  These are the origin of instruments and their closure practices These two indicators bene˜t from OP requirements  that establish clear rules for these areas of design and implementation Accounting for products of the instrument  identi˜cation of bene˜ciaries and selection criteria in design and ability to learn systematically from experience  with the instrument are other areas of better practice There is some more variation on the ME by design that is  in this quadrant by a small margin which is related to how well adjusted the centralized digital platform used for  ME is to the needs of speci˜c instruments See  Annex C Detailed Findings of the Functional Analysis  for more  detailed ˜ndings from the Functional Analysis 43 CHAPTER 4     CONCLUSIONS 44 C HAPTER  4   C ONCLUSIONS The analysis above leads to various conclusions about the policy mix and function of the instruments that Romania  is using to promote entrepreneurship The ˜rst conclusion that may be drawn is that the concentration of spending on a few instruments leaves many  smaller instruments that may be ine˚ective  Within the complete collection of STI instruments at the national level  the ﬁpolicy mixﬂ spending is highly concentrated on a few instruments The largest instrument amounts to about  half the yearly average budget while three of the 50 instruments account for half the total average yearly budget  This high concentration means that the remainder is composed of many instruments with small budgets that are  probably not of suf˜cient scale to have an impact given that some of the administration costs are likely to be ˜xed  Second the issue with the small scale of many instruments is compounded by the fact that many of them  aim for several objectives simultaneously  Along with the high concentration of the budget on a few instruments  many instruments attempt to achieve a diversity of objectives both general objectives and speci˜c objectives and  there is overlap between them The combination of a relatively large number of instruments with small budgets and  several objectives suggests that there may be lack of clarity in the design of instruments to focus the intervention  Most instruments already have a relatively small scale and the problem is compounded by the lack of specialized  focus because more resources are required to attend to multiple objectives Having many interventions with small  budgets and complex purposes raises an important question about the potential effectiveness of the policy mix  Third most instruments assume that money is the only barrier to achieving changes in the innovation sys tem  This assumption can be inferred from the fact that most instruments use grants or matching grants as the  mechanism of intervention The dominance of grantbased subsidies is not unusual It is present in many coun tries However it must be kept in mind that grants assume that the only problem that needs resolution from the  public intervention perspective is lack of money and that all other factors contributing to innovation entrepre neurship productivity and competitiveness are available or reachable if money is made available This assump tion is almost certainly false it is highly unlikely that this is the true condition of the STI system in Romania or any  other nascent innovation system  Moreover grants can sometimes have negative e˚ects  The potential negative effects can include market dis tortion for example disadvantaging other businesses that do not receive grants thereby distorting investment  and other economic activity grant dependency for example creating organizations that cannot compete without  grants or subsidies and so rely on continued public support and lobbying for example increasing the incentive  for ˜rms to lobby the government instead of engaging in productive activities Given the stage of development of  Romania™s ecosystem we suggest that such distortionary effects are not a concern at this time Nevertheless it is  important to review the effectiveness of grants as agents of change in STI For example recent work on technol ogy adoption suggests that managerial practices and the lack of knowledge and skills within the ˜rms is often a  greater barrier to adoption than the access to the material technology itself so grants solely for technology acqui sition are likely to have limited impact  Many instruments use multiple intervention mechanisms that are unlikely to be e˚ective in all of their dimen sions  Numerous instruments invoke multiple causal mechanisms to in˚uence the system In addition to the pre vious observations about the small scale of a great majority of instruments and the diversity of their objectives  it is very dif˜cult for them to be effective in all these dimensions Given the expected complexity of multiple types  of intervention the administrative cost of these instruments is very likely to exceed their speci˜c budget and sig ni˜cantly reduce their chances of impact Different mechanisms typically require capabilities that are not comple mentary and are rarely found in one agency or of˜ce at the same time Therefore instruments that have multiple  forms of intervention may create challenges for ef˜cient administration and should be reviewed  In addition to the diversity of objectives and types of intervention many instruments also indicate multiple  types of bene˜ciaries  All the comments on the multiplicity of intervention mechanisms are applicable here The  best practices for managing public instruments suggest specialization in terms of bene˜ciaries even within the  same class This ˜nding is another reason to recommend a rationalization of STI instruments The lack of specialization among instruments focused on the private sector may further challenge their e˚ec tiveness  There is little specialization among instruments focused on the private sector Many of them simultaneously  45 C HAPTER  4   C ONCLUSIONS target ˜rms of several sizes and life cycle stages However ˜rms of different sizes and stages of the life cycle face  very different challenges and have different needs Experience indicates that each of these business activity seg ments requires special skills to serve them For example the policies to support a small startup with highgrowth  ambition potentially working in a ˜eld of emerging technology may be very different from the policies needed to  support SMEs in general It is very dif˜cult for a uniform set of interventions to effectively address all these is sues simultaneously Small instruments with such an ambitious spectrum of care requirements are highly unlike ly to have such capabilities It is worth considering ˜netuning these instruments to address a better characteri zation of ˜rm needs by targeting their intervention  In addition where targeting exists this may sometimes be counterproductive to the creation of new high growth ventures  For example several instruments are targeted at mature ˜rms regardless of their size than  for ˜rms in the very early stages of starting up this may potentially reinforce the role of incumbents rather than  encouraging the growth of innovative startups In addition several instruments are available only to ˜rms that are  already pro˜table however experience from other countries suggests that many startups that are high growth  and ultimately very pro˜table may undergo a considerable prerevenue period during which they are focused on  growth and useradoption Relatedly many instruments speci˜cally target established technologies at high tech nology readiness levels TRLs that is mature marketready technologieshowever a supportive innovation eco system needs to provide support for technologies across the spectrum of technology readiness from the labora tory to the market Very few instruments address management practices linkages with foreign ˜rms or market access  Academic  research indicated that these play an important role in technology adoption and exporting respectively but these  areas receive little attention Moreover although skills formation and technology transfer seem to be the two  most common objectives for instruments none of the instruments examined by this study were strictly dedicated  to these objectives  Business enablers and individual entrepreneurs have little direct funding  In many ecosystems business ena blers   Š   including accelerators and incubators   Š   play an important role However such organizations appear to have  both a relatively low number of instruments and a relatively small overall budget directed towards them Individual  entrepreneurs as opposed to ˜rms also have very little direct funding There are consistent weaknesses in the logic model of instruments  The functional analysis of the instruments  showed that logic models were generally weak as were the models™ associated inputs objectives outcomes and  incentives Weaknesses in the logic model of instruments as well as mediocre justi˜cation of the programs may  possibly be linked with the origins of some instruments In some cases the starting point for the development of  an instrument appears not to have been the internal identi˜cation of a market failure and the subsequent develop ment of a logic model but rather a desire to follow the direction of the EC and the Priority Axis objectives However  it is important fully to understand the rationale and logic of the Commission™s guidance and to translate this into a  logic model for each instrument a clearer logic model and justi˜cation will then support numerous other aspects  of each instrument™s development such as more speci˜c objectives and outcomes better accounting of inputs  improved targeting and consideration of alternative instruments  Instruments™ budgets were often missized  This includes both undershoot and overshoot This issue is likely  related to the problem of having many interventions with small budgets This again suggests that some rationali zation   Š   or expansion of the more successful programs   Š   may be warranted  Greater evaluation at the instrument level is needed  ME was often weaker at the instrument level than at the  program level or Priority Axis level There appeared to be good processes for evaluating the overall impact of the  portfolio of instruments and also relatively good processes for tracking and evaluating individual projects that are  supported by a speci˜c instrument However evaluation and comparison of the instruments themselves seems to  be less clear Improving this will allow better decisions about how to rationalize the policy mix  The administrative structure of several instruments appears suboptimal  Many instruments were structured  with an MA and an IB This seems very likely to introduce some additional friction and costs Although this struc ture may be a necessary condition for some European funds it is important to pay close attention to the interface  46 C HAPTER  4   C ONCLUSIONS between organizations Improved process monitoring may help assess this friction and determine whether it is  improving or worsening over time In general the dual role of EC rules and regulations was perceived in Romania  as well as it neighbors that also receive EU structural funds On the positive side origination of policies rules for  closures engagement with stakeholders are constructive elements of following EC guidance to set up the instru ments along the axes of the EC OP in the country On the other hand in some areas compliance with the rules is  substituted for better functionality because more technically sophisticated logic models and indicators useful for  guiding ME and implementation generally are not developed beyond minimum compliance requirements The  project did not have suf˜cient information on similarities andor differences with nationally funded instruments  to carry out a comparison Implementation capacity requires further examination  There were suggestions from the research supported  both by ecosystem stakeholders and other World Bank research that implementation capacity might be a signif icant constraint  47 CHAPTER 5

this exercise coincides with  Romania™s review and development of new operational programming Lessons from this analysis can be applied  to the future policy mix especially when it comes to improving program management which impacts how pro grams are designed implemented and evaluated  1 Rationalize the overall portfolio of instruments to reduce the number of small instruments that are likely to  be ineffective due to their scale Shortterm 2 Improve instrumentlevel evaluation to enable better comparison of instruments™ effectiveness and hence  inform ongoing decisions about which instruments to scale up with attention to smaller pilot instruments that  may hold promise Such evaluations should look at both ef˜ciency and effectiveness following modules 3 and 4  of the PER STI methodology Shortterm 3 Clarify the instrument™s objective that is the rationale or speci˜c market failure it is trying to address and  consider instruments that are more focused and speci˜c Although multipurpose instruments can be effective  and rationalization may push towards fewer instruments that are more general in scope the current portfolio  of multipurpose instruments is likely to have a diluted impact It may also make instrumentlevel evaluation and  comparison more dif˜cult Shortterm 4 Ensure that in the comprehensive set of instruments there are specialized ones designed for companies in  the early stages of technology readiness and market readiness and for companies with aspirations for scale  There needs to be more support targeted towards prerevenue startups and individual entrepreneurs This includes  addressing management practices linkages with foreign ˜rms and market access This also includes separate  dedicated instruments for skills formation and technology transfer rather than these being joint objectives along side others Shortterm 5 Instruments should have an explicit logic model   Š   a hypothesized chain of causes and effects leading to the  desired outcomes Further development of such models is linked with clearer justi˜cation for each instrument  and should enable better accounting of inputs improved targeting of the instrument as well as prompting ideas  for alternative instruments Shortterm 6 Further support privatesector business enablers including accelerators and incubators In most ecosystems  these have an important role to play although in Romania such organizations currently have a relatively small  overall budget directed towards them Shortterm 7 Consider a wider range of mechanisms besides grants tailored appropriately to type of ˜rms and stage of  ˜rms Grants are useful ˜nancing mechanisms for the earliest stages of entrepreneurs including startups and  ˜rms with riskier business models who often rely on self˜nancing For other types of ˜rms loan guarantees tax  incentives and reforms to public procurement may be as effective as grants in some circumstances while hav ing a less distortionary effect on markets and reducing the risk of grantdependency Shorttomedium term 8 Continue to reduce the administrative burden on applicants Many instruments showed good signs of having  been simpli˜ed or otherwise reformed to make it easier for applicants However the fact that many applicants  still rely on thirdparty consultants and advisors indicates that there is room for further improvement Shortto medium term 9 Be aware of the administrative burden on staff It was apparent from interviews that the burden of audits and  other internal administration is a considerable cost in the management of many instruments Particularly where  instruments are subscale this will reduce their impact There may be opportunities to increase staff motivation  Shorttomedium term 49 C HAPTER  5   R ECOMMENDATIONS   TO  I MPROVE

Refocus attention on starting and scaling highquality innovative ˜rms        TARGET BENEFICIARIES   Young innovative ˜rms at the earliest stages of technologyreadiness and marketreadiness and eco system enablers       RATIONALE     As discussed in Part One of this report Romania™s current policy mix for STI and entrepreneurship  is not optimized for ˜rms at the earliest stages and entrepreneurs nor does it address the quality of  ˜rms at entry and the limited number of highgrowth ˜rms in the ecosystem Romania hovers at round  3 percent of highgrowth ˜rms compared to 114 percent in peer countries This re˚ects policymak ers™ limited understanding of how startups differ from small and medium enterprises SMEs because  many instruments target postrevenue ˜rms Our functional analysis of existing support programs reveals that  Ł   Many instruments are underdisbursing suggesting misalignment between the instrument™s ob jectives and target bene˜ciaries  Ł   Several instruments are targeted at mature ˜rms regardless of their size rather than for ˜rms in  the very early stages of development  Ł   Additionally several instruments are available only to ˜rms that are already pro˜table This  likely excludes highgrowth startups because they typically undergo a considerable prerev enue period during which they are focused on growth and useradoption During this stage  highgrowth startups typically rely on grants or ˜nancing from accelerators angel investors  or venture capitalists VCs  Ł   Relatedly many instruments speci˜cally target established technologies at high TRLs that is  mature marketready technologies however a supportive innovation ecosystem needs to pro vide support for technologies across the spectrum of technologyreadiness zz MISSION  CRITICAL

Individual entrepreneurs as opposed to ˜rms have little direct funding  Ł   Very few policy instruments bene˜t ecosystem enablers such as incubators accelerators and  other critical actors Efforts to recalibrate the policy mix must also include improving attention to  national and localized entrepreneurship ecosystems As discussed in a forthcoming recommen dation Romania™s subnational entrepreneurial ecosystems vary in quality of support which in  turn translates to limited support to startups and innovative ˜rms  Ł   Some instruments existed because of the direction of the EC rather than having been identi˜ed  as a particular systemic failure Ł   Administrative costs for program management are high because it requires coordination between  an MA  and  an IB  Ł   ME capabilities of program staff are weak limiting opportunities to understand the impact of  existing instruments and scaling up of programs that are meeting andor exceeding program ob jectives This indicates a need to improve capabilities of program implementors for design im plementation and governance with a special focus on ME       APPROACH     This recommendation is divided into three speci˜c subcategories  1A Rebalancing the policy mix  1B Improving functionality of the policy mix and  2 Passing and implementing a comprehensive package of reforms that is the National Startup Eco system Strategy PART 1A REBALANCING THE POLICY MIX As a ˜rst step towards rebalancing the policy mix policymakers should rationalize the overall portfo lio of instruments to reduce the number of small instruments that are likely to be ineffective due to  their scale with a view to reallocate these resources to launch new instruments targeting earlierstage  ˜rms There are many instruments with small budgets that are probably not of suf˜cient scale to have  an impact given that some of the administration costs are likely to be ˜xed  Policymakers should also clarify the instrument™s objectives and target bene˜ciaries Many instruments  list multiple objectives simultaneously andor target multiple types of bene˜ciaries It is very dif˜cult  for them to be effective in all these dimensions Given the expected complexity of multiple types of in terventions the administrative cost of these instruments is very likely to exceed their speci˜c budget  and signi˜cantly reduce their chances of impact PART 1B IMPROVING FUNCTIONALITY OF THE  POLICY MIX Romania currently has limited institutional capacity to design implement and evaluate instruments  for ˜rms at both levels Relatedly monitoring impact of programs is weak and there are missed op portunities in identifying highperforming policy instruments and applying those implementation les sons to other support programs  57 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  1 R ECALIBRATE   THE   POLICY   MIX   FOR   STARTING   AND   SCALING   HIGH  Q UALITY INNOVATIVE   FIRMS Other activities to improve functionality of the policy mix include improving program governance sim plifying application processes to reduce administrative burden for potential bene˜ciaries as well as  program staff and improving the selection process PART 2 PASSING AND IMPLEMENTING A  COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF REFORMS THAT IS  THE NATIONAL STARTUP ECOSYSTEM STRATEGY  Many countries are consolidating regulatory reforms under an entrepreneurship strategy or under a  Startup or Small Business Act Such entrepreneurship strategies typically include speci˜c policy sup port and funding instruments for riskier ˜rms in the earliest stages when the rationale for public inter vention is greatest Romania™s access to ˜nance interventions embedded within the strategy should  be informed by an indepth study on the existing entrepreneurial ˜nance The startup ecosystem strat egy also needs to take a nuanced approach towards supporting ˜rms While support to ˜rms at the  ideation stages remains a gap in public sector instruments there also needs to be a focus on provid ing support for startups throughout the entrepreneurial lifecycle Romania™s National Startup Ecosystem Strategy should also include the establishment of a new in stitution a onestop agency or ﬁecosystem hubﬂ that will be responsible for implementing programs  and policies for entrepreneurs       POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION BODY     This agenda would bene˜t from commitment at the highest level of the Government This is current ly led by the Ministry of European Funds with support from the relevant line ministries including the  Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Tourism Ministry of Research Innovation and Digitalization MOR ID and Ministry of Economy At the implementation level this is delegated to MAs of Ministries and  Regional Development Agencies dealing with Regional Operational Programs        RISK   A key risk for Recommendation 1 as well as Recommendation 2 is that this will require a high degree  of internal coordination including coordination with other strategies such as the Digitalization Strategy  The champion of these reforms will have to be able to work with authority and credibility across the mul tiple departments and other bodies concerned this will require strong leadership and political support  Other key risks include lack of awareness among policymakers about the specialized needs of start up ˜rms which include a specialized ecosystem with funding access to networks mentors and mar kets Rebalancing the policy mix 1A and improving functionality of the policy mix 1B also requires  buyin and coordination from the EC MAs and the IBs  Further risks include lack of a cohesive approach to supporting startups such as a national start up ecosystem strategy and lack of a centralized institution such as a onestop agency or ﬁecosystem  hubﬂ to lead implementation on this agenda In many countries innovation agencies oversee public in terventions for STI and entrepreneurship whereas startup support organizations engage in advocacy  around the special needs of innovative growthoriented ˜rms Romania lacks such institutional capacity        AMOUNT   •15 million based on preliminary costing of calibrating policy mix plus

Related Regulations SUPPORT DISTRESSED BUSINESSES AND EASE EXITS        RATIONALE   Although Romania performs well on entry of new ˜rms it does not have a high share of tech start ups and especially highpotential startups Much entrepreneurship in Romania is driven by necessi ty rather than opportunity with many ˜rms lacking the ambition to innovate or other characteristics  to become highgrowth ˜rms Additionally Romania does not have a culture that destigmatizes ﬁrapid  business failureﬂ and promotes serial entrepreneurship Easing ˜rm exit and providing entrepreneurs  the possibility of discharge of debts and the possibility of a fresh start would help reduce the number  of so called ﬁzombie ˜rmsﬂ and encourages the reallocation of resources to more productive new en trant ˜rms while encouraging further entrepreneurship  61 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  2 R EFORM   REGULATIONS   TO   STRENGTHEN   ENTREPRENEURSHIP  AND  INVESTMENTS       APPROACH     This requires a major shift in

not access traditional capital markets for scaling up Instead they rely on angel investors VCs includ ing corporate venture capital andor crowdfunding platforms       APPROACH     Introduce or strengthen regulations to incentivize private sector investment activity in growth ˜rms  This includes regulations around stock options angel investment corporate and venture capital reg ulations and crowdfunding Ł   Enable Stock Options for Employees  Employee ownership and compensation via stock op tions are used as incentives by highgrowth ˜rms in many startup ecosystems Provision of stock  options allows cashstrapped startups to compete for talent against larger but less innovative  companies by attracting employees with the potential substantial ˜nancial gains that may result  from a successful exit Current Romanian legislation is perceived as unfavorable for the creation  and use of ESOPs employee stock options plans  Ł   Angel and Corporate Venture Capital Investor Incentives  Venture capital is a critical resource  for many startups This may take a variety of forms including ‚Angel™ funding and corporate ven ture capital CVC 12  In many ecosystems public policy instruments are thus used to incentivize  venture capital these often take the form of tax incentives for example the United Kingdom™s En terprise Investment Scheme and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and coinvestment funds  Current Romanian incentives are perceived as insuf˜cient and the legislation surrounding busi ness angel and business angel syndicate investment is also seen as unfavorable and confusing  It is therefore suggested that a clearer package of incentives for earlystage investors is needed  Ł   Crowdfunding  In Romania as in other ecosystems crowdfunding is ˜lling a critical gap in ear lystage ˜nancing for startups In line with the EU Directive on Crowdfunding we suggest devel oping and publishing equity crowdfunding guidelines or regulations for Romania        IMPLEMENTATION BODY   The implementation body for this reform is the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the Ministry  of Investment and EU Projects and the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Tourism       RISK   This requires coordination between several entities because they are each responsible for a piece of  the entrepreneurship agenda The reforms should also be informed by the private sector speci˜cally

domes tic market for startups while simultaneously helping bring bene˜cial innovations into the public sector        APPROACH     With assistance from the World Bank the National Public Procurement Agency has been undertaking  signi˜cant reforms of the public procurement system World Bank 2020b We recommend conduct ing a rapid analysis of existing public procurement policies platforms and systems to identify how  startups as opposed to other MSMEs can be better integrated into the public procurement system  this should also seek to identify the extent to which startups are applicants and winners of tenders This analysis may bene˜t from a review of how other countries are approaching inclusion of young  ˜rms within their public procurement systems in order to identify common barriers For example we  suggest the review consider whether startups and other MSMEs are excluded through the use of  quali˜cation criteria such as International Organization for Standardization ISO certi˜cation or in demnities whether public bodies overspecify tenders for example assuming the use of legacy tech nologies and approaches and thus inadvertently excluding innovative solutions whether large ten ders can be broken into smaller pieces in order to fall within the capacity of smaller ˜rms and whether  tenders are advertised in suf˜cient time to allow smaller ˜rms to identify these and respond appro priately The review should also attempt to measure the proportion of public procurement process es that are publicized through the existing eprocurement system for example whether this is in fact  100 percent as well as the percentage of respondents and successful winners that are startups as  opposed to other MSMEs  Although data concerning applicants and winners of tenders is published by the Public Procurement  Agency annually for example ANAP 2021 we recommend that this data should ideally be made  available on a realtime basis ideally with an application programming interface API to the dataset  increasing the openness and timeliness of data concerning procurement will assist in identifying sec tors or bodies that are able to work more effectively with startups or SMEs and hence suggest prac tices that might be adopted by other bodies Furthermore we suggest that there may be bene˜t in experimenting with novel procurement models  such as Challenge Prizes   Š   an ‚outcomeled™ approachagnostic model that has been used effectively  elsewhere to drive innovation and encourage new suppliers Providing dedicated training to procure ment personnel concerning such innovative procurement processes as well as the differences in volved in working with startups may also be bene˜cial this could potentially be managed by the pro posed onestop agency or Startup

RATIONALE   The Romanian Startup ecosystem faces several challenges including a lack of understanding of start ups and how they differ from other SMEs and reliable data about the ecosystem as a whole SME  legislation and the policy mix do not take into account the needs of young growthoriented ˜rms with  novel technology or new business models There is also poor coordination between policymakers and  startup ecosystem stakeholders Despite promising regional clusters Romanian startups have no co herent national voice to champion their needs  Research shows a wide variety of successful models differing in purpose structure and the type of  instruments and interventions they manage Glennie and Bound 2016 Nevertheless Aridi and Ka pil 2019 identify common ingredients of success in such agencies particularly in emerging national  innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems such as Romania™s including a clear but adaptable mis sion technically capable staff effective governance and management structures diagnosticbased  interventions robust ME sustainable funding and strategic partnerships and networks It will be  important for the organization to receive suf˜cient and continuous budget and to be able to recruit  appropriate talent this might require exceptions to salary caps  Some speci˜c examples of bodies that might serve as a template for this agency include the Israeli In novation Authority a governmentfunded entity   Š   established under the Chief Scientist™s Of˜ce   Š   that  administers an RD Fund for startups an Incubator Program and extensive startup

posttransition economies very often the innovation or startup programming and agencies are es tablished under the auspices of a ministry in charge of research innovation science and technolog ical

negate issues  of policy capture by incumbents by providing a different cabinetlevel champion assist in promot ing technology transfer and sciencedriven spinouts and ensure that the agency remains focused on       APPROACH     We recommend that the ˜rst step should be to draft a ‚blueprint™ of the new agency taking into con sideration the different roles that it might play The overall objective of establishing an ecosystem hub  is to create an institutional framework and implementation capacity to address structural challenges  for startups scaleups and facilitators of innovation and entrepreneurship support However there  are many different models of innovation agency or startup agency and we recommend that the struc ture of this organization be determined after the strategy has been developed Potential roles for this  agency include Ł   Role 1   Š   Advocate Identi˜es and promotes the specialized needs of seed startup scaleup phase  companies and their investors Ł   Role 2   Š   Think and Do Tank Pilots new interventions and tests their relevance for startups and  the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem This could include support for the design and  implementation

‚blueprint™ All six potential roles are valuable but there may be value in a tighter focus during  the initial establishment of the agency Further considerations for its establishment include Ł   Ensuring that the Agency remains agile in order to adapt to ‚radical uncertainty™ and the rapid  pace of change that often accompanies innovative startups Ł   An initial focusing on short and

understand National Innovation System gaps and global trends to in form evolving agency missions and to design and implement policy interventions Ł   Implementing robust ME Many agencies   Š   for example the Croatian Agency for SMEs Innovation  and Investments HAMAGBICRO   Š   use external organizations to measure program outputs De veloping internal ME capabilities would enable evaluation

as well as technical capabilities Ł   Identifying sustainable funding Some agencies™ reliance upon one source of funding for exam ple ˚uctuating government funding creates uncertainty and can lead to operational and program matic challenges For example  EU Structural Funds represent up to 80 percent of the budget  of Poland™s NCBIR       IMPLEMENTATION BODY   The Ministry of Research Innovation and Digitization or the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Tour ism would likely be the sponsoring authority for this policy recommendation This could also possibly  be an initiative established jointly by the Regional Development Agencies       RISKS   Key risks include identifying a ministry to sponsor the establishment of this entity This may be a chal lenge because some policymakers are hesitant to establish a new agency Other risks are retaining  skilled staff ensuring good ME practices to prove traction and build business case for longerterm  support and securing public funding for

entrepreneurship support provided by ecosystem enablers in Romania       TARGET BENEFICIARIES   Ecosystem enablers including but not limited to incubators accelerators angels VC funds corporates  interested in launching or improving their startup support programs public actors       RATIONALE   In most ecosystems ecosystem enablers or ‚startup support organizations™ play an important role  There is evidence for example that accelerators can not only improve various success measures for  startups that receive their services but may also play a wider ecosystem coordinating function Bone  et al 2019 However at present there are relatively few such enablers in Romania and those that  exist are of limited capacity and variable quality Most lack a rigorous ME framework which limits  opportunities for learning and suggests the need for sharing good practices more widely As indicat ed by the policy mix analysis above there are relatively few instruments that are devoted to support ing ecosystem enablers meaning that many ecosystem enablers are underresourced and rely on ˜ nancing and support from donors In addition existing ecosystem enablers are concentrated primarily in the BucharestIlfov region with  few entrepreneurship support structures outside of the main hubs Enabler organizations located be yond the main hubs tend to have weaker access to networks including ˜nancial capital and capacity  building Given that the BucharestIlfov region has the highest rate of new ˜rm creation and highest  share of young and highgrowth ˜rms it is understandable that privatesector enablers would choose  to locate themselves here where demand is greatest However this concentration risks exacerbating  regional economic disparities  Data suggests that the major ecosystems outside the BucharestIlfov region are around ClujNapoca  Iasi Timisoara and Constanta However the data also suggests that startups in these other ecosys tems remain highly dependent upon the Bucharest ecosystem for university talent and facilities ac celerators and funders ˜gure 63  FLAGSHIP  72 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  4 S TRENGTHEN   ECOSYSTEM   ENABLERS       APPROACH     We suggest the need for a program to strengthen ecosystem enablers across Romania The aim of  such program would be to build overall capacity especially outside the BucharestIlfov region to im prove quality and performance measurement and to increase the connections between enablers in  order to encourage sharing of good practice as well as their access to resources  The program should also include capacitydevelopment grants for ecosystem enablers potential ly requiring matched funding from other sources such as local authorities venture capitalists or cor porates Such grants could be spent in various ways including such activities as subsidized maker spaces rapidprototyping facilities and the provision of stipends from accelerators to entrepreneurs  in order to allow founders to concentrate on startupbuilding activities as is common in many other  accelerator programs  We note that several wellestablished accelerators outside Romania have established programs  on behalf of other sponsoring organizations Attracting international acceleration programs into Ro mania may therefore be an alternative way to establish programs in country and to expand capacity        IMPLEMENTATION BODY   This will be implemented by the Ministry of Research Innovation and Digitalization       RISKS   Key risks include limited collaboration between subnational ecosystem actors This

stages       RATIONALE   Risk ˜nance is a critical requirement for starting and scaling new ˜rms However the Romanian ven ture capital sector is underdeveloped meaning that venture capital remains dif˜cult to access Num bers of VC deals and total value invested are low in comparison with other European countries   Š   al though numbers of deals and transaction value increased quite rapidly between 2019 and 2021 As  discussed in the policy mix analysis above available public instruments prioritize postrevenue ˜rms  and do not provide ˜nancial support for ˜rms at the earliest and riskiest stages        APPROACH     This recommendation proposes establishing a new public fund to increase amount of direct capital  into startups and riskier stage ˜rms 13  The design of the Startup Fund and its instruments should be  informed by an indepth study of the existing entrepreneurial ˜nance landscape including the existing  supply of Corporate Venture Capital and investment from overseas VC ˜rms as well as estimates of  likely demand from Romanian startups and speci˜c ˜nancing gaps 14  However we suggest that care ful consideration be given to its establishment as a coinvestment fund in order to encourage the de velopment of private sector VCs rather than displace this activity  Although the fund could be government owned it is strongly recommended that it involves privatesec tor partners and management expertise including a performancedriven process for investment se lection and due consideration of the need to develop a pipeline of suf˜cient deal˚ow to sustain the  development of private sector investors There may be opportunities to leverage the diaspora network  see recommendation below to identify coinvestors In terms of fund size and stage there is a particular need for preseed and seedstage funding in Ro mania so we suggest that a sizeable portion of the fund should be dedicated to these stages The ex act size of the fund should be determined following the proposed study However to provide an indica tion of size we note that average preseed rounds in Romania were around •150000 in 2021 with  seed rounds averaging around •1 million A fund of •91 million would thus allow approximately twen ty preseed investments per year plus ten seed investments per year over a period of 7 years assum ing no coinvestment and no growth in round sizes coinvestment would obviously permit a greater  number of investments andor allow some of the fund to be reserved for later stages  13 In recognition of the public sector™s role in supporting startups many countries are launching speci˜c ˜nance instruments  This list includes France Serbia Chile and many others 14 Though the EIF recently conducted an landscape analysis to inform a Fund of Funds intervention within the National Resilience  and Recovery Plan riskier stage ˜rms including startups still appear to be unserved or underserved by this proposed instrument FLAGSHIP  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT NEEDED  75 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  5 C REATE   A   STARTUP   FUND We further recommend that the fund be developed in coordination with the startup grant schemes dis cussed below see ‚Incentivize innovation to foster knowledge spillovers into the private sector™ be cause grants may to an extent displace the need for equitybased fundraising or vice versa At the  present time we suggest that both recommendations are needed however it may be appropriate to  shift resources from one instrument to the other in response to changing ecosystem needs        IMPLEMENTATION BODY   We suggest that the Ministry of Research Innovation and Digitalization could be responsible for initial  study and design of the fund However the establishment of the fund could be overseen by another  national body such as the onestop agency or ﬁecosystem hubﬂ with subsequent management be ing overseen by this body or by an independent board In either case we suggest that such the fund  should have strong privatesector investor involvement and governance mechanisms        RISKS   Improper design can potentially displace or otherwise harm the development of private sector ven ture capital Insuf˜cient private sector expertise can lead to poor investment decisions or terms that  dissuade private sector investors from subsequent investment Policymakers lack awareness of how  a startup fund differs from a SME fund The onestop agency proposed as one potential implementa tion body has yet to be established       AMOUNT   Approximate costs are as follows Activity Estimated Cost • Conducting an

RECOMMENDATION 6     IMPROVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION  AND STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF UNIVERSITIES  IN THE ECOSYSTEM       OBJECTIVE   Improve quality and reach of entrepreneurship education by improving the translational role of the ed ucation system and partnership with industry       TARGET BENEFICIARIES   Students and University Staff including management       RATIONALE   Universities can play many important roles in stimulating entrepreneurship   Š   such as inspiring stu dents and cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset providing entrepreneurial skills directly assisting  the formation of spinouts and transferring technologies to existing young ˜rms to enable them to be come more innovative However most of these functions are weaker in Romania than in other Euro pean countries Although Romania has a high share of science technology engineering and mathe matics STEM graduates this has not translated into high numbers of innovative startups  Many leading entrepreneurial universities such as the Stockholm School of Business Aalto Univer sity in Finland the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Berkely Stanford and many others  aim to complement formal entrepreneurship education with campus extracurricular activities includ ing hackathons competitions acceleration and even access to VC funding from the university This  type of practical education helps to support the change of culture and mindset within the university  and creates an ‚incampus startup ecosystem™  In contrast however the quality of Romanian entrepreneurship education is a particular concern  Although there have been numerous programs to improve entrepreneurial training many entrepre neurs still complain that their university education did not provide them with appropriate knowledge  or skills with academic teaching of entrepreneurship being perceived as low quality outdated insuf ˜ciently practical and disconnected from realworld experience This is exacerbated by the fact that  many teachers and lecturing staff have limited exposure to the private sector Entrepreneurial skills  also pose considerable challenges to university management including staff responsible for overall  planning and budgeting and academic development  In addition university technology transfer of˜ces TTOs are relatively undeveloped In many other eco systems university spinouts are an important contributor to the total numbers of startups especially  at the highertechnology end of the spectrum However a functional review of the Romanian RD sys tem World Bank 2011 that examined   the institutional framework for commercialization found that  technology transfer capabilities were weak potentially hampering the formation of spinouts as well  as other mechanisms such as licensing and contributing to the low levels of innovation amongst Ro manian ˜rms There is some evidence that Romanian universities ˜le patents merely to satisfy the  requirements of funding instrument and mostly without a clear commercialization strategy Limited  FLAGSHIP  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT NEEDED  77 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  6 I MPROVE   ENTREPRENEURSHIP   EDUCATION   AND   STRENGTHEN   THE   ROLE   OF   UNIVERSITIES   IN   THE   ECOSYSTEM resources and the lack of a strategic approach also means that most patent applications never pro ceed beyond local ˜ling and are not taken to the Patent Cooperation Treaty PCT phase or beyond  The lack of linkages between research organizations and ˜rms has signi˜cant impact upon Romanian  business as discussed in the following recommendation as well as in the interlinked  Output 1  Vari ous approaches to improve linkages are being trialed in the World Bank™s current ‚Supporting Innova tion in Romanian Catchingup Regions™ project This project supports the EC™s efforts to build the in stitutional capacity of Romanian catchingup regions to design and implement regional Innovation   Entrepreneurship support programs based on international good practices Under this engagement  the World Bank is building the capacity at the regional level to design and roll out innovation programs  The conclusions of that project should be read alongside these Recommendations        APPROACH     Several previous projects funded by the EC have tried to improve entrepreneurial skills training and  ‚third mission™ activities within Romanian universities In addition a number of highly relevant pilot  programs were implemented in the World Bank project ‚Supporting Innovation in Romanian Catch ingup Regions™ We therefore recommend that a review of these projects is undertaken before new  initiatives are launched or these programs are scaled  In addition we suggest that this section should be read with reference to the others speci˜cally there  may be opportunities to combine entrepreneurial skills training with digital skills training as discussed  under ‚Promote the Digital Economy™ and a need to coordinate the supplyside interventions dis cussed in this section with the demandsize interventions of the following section ‚Incentivize innova tion to foster knowledge spillovers into the private sector™ With that said we recommend that several actions would improve entrepreneurship education for stu dents for career counselors and university lecturers as well as building wider entrepreneurial capa bilities within these institutions and engagement with the wider ecosystem  REMOVING REGULATORY HURDLES FOR  ENTREPRENEURIAL EDUCATION Exposure to successful entrepreneurs may be expected to inspire and encourage prospective entre preneurs as well as helping entrepreneurial education remain relevant and up to date Currently how ever many ecosystem members believe that the regulations for guest lecturers at schools and univer sities prevent entrepreneurs and mentors without a teaching quali˜cation from speaking to students  These regulations should be relaxed or clari˜ed to allow educational institutions to provide students  with more direct exposure to entrepreneurs and industry experts  INFUSING ACADEMIA WITH ENTREPRENEURS AND  INDUSTRY EXPERTS TO FACILITATE KNOWLEDGE  TRANSFER As well as inviting guest lecturers universities should improve and encourage mobility between the  private sector and academia more broadly This may require changes to staff recruitment policies for  example it is common for academic institutions to place heavy emphasis on the publication history of  academic staff but the output of papers is likely to be reduced while working in industry  78 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  6 I MPROVE   ENTREPRENEURSHIP   EDUCATION   AND   STRENGTHEN   THE   ROLE   OF   UNIVERSITIES   IN   THE   ECOSYSTEM EDUCATOR TRAINING  STUDY VISITS For existing university professors and lecturers to increase their practical knowledge about entrepre neurship and ensure that this is up to date we propose a program to ‚educate the educators™ in cluding facilitating lecturer exchange programs   Š   for example inviting entrepreneurs to visit leading  institutions in Romania as well as funding study visits of Romanian academic staff to visit highly en trepreneurial universities and welldeveloped startup ecosystems abroad Closer links between uni versities and enabler organizations could also be part of this action INCENTIVES  METRICS FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP     ENTREPRENEURIAL EDUCATION Existing obligations on universities to attempt to facilitate technology transfer and to report the im pact of this are insuf˜cient motivators for entrepreneurial behavior amongst staff and students We  suggest the need to develop and implement speci˜c incentives   Š   at both an institutional level and an  individual level   Š   for universities high schools and other formal and informal education institutions  in order to encourage both entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial education These incentives may be  ˜nancial   Š   such as speci˜c public funding that is linked with entrepreneurial outcomes However they  could also be non˜nancial   Š   such as rewarding entrepreneurial experience or industry involvement  by staff with faster promotion or even specifying this a requirement for career progression the allo cation of free time to entrepreneurial activities or the prestige of awards To accompany this we suggest that the annual metrics for enterprise engagement that universities  are required to publish should be expanded to include a wider range of entrepreneurship and enter prise activities This might include the number of students participating in startup events for exam ple hackathons and business plan competitions the number of students receiving enterprise edu cation lessons the number of students or staff attending timebound practical residencies in ˜rms  the number of student spinouts etc  ESTABLISHING AN ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR  EDUCATIONAL REFORMS To ensure that entrepreneurship education remains as relevant as possible we recommend the es tablishment of an advisory group or council comprising of public representatives and key stakehold ers from the Romanian startup ecosystem incubators accelerators VCs angel investors founders  industry representatives and diaspora This body would work with policymakers and institutions to  help identify possible ongoing educational reforms The same body could also advise on the action  above in terms of determining metrics that members consider most relevant and in terms of advocat ing for other measures that may promote academicindustry mobility and enterprise awareness such  as sponsored studentships etc 79 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  6 I MPROVE   ENTREPRENEURSHIP   EDUCATION   AND   STRENGTHEN   THE   ROLE   OF   UNIVERSITIES   IN   THE   ECOSYSTEM EXPANSION OF RESEARCH VALORIZATION FUND The World Bank™s project on ‚Supporting Innovation in Romanian Catchingup Regions™ piloted the ap plication of research valorization grants in two regions Such grants are not intended to fund basic re search but to test or demonstrate the potential for the commercial application of previous research  Qualifying activities may include market research and analysis demonstrating technical feasibility   proofofconcept certifying and compliance for example demonstrating that a technology can meet  a particular industry requirement and so on  We recommend that this pilot scheme be reviewed and expanded We suggest that grants ranging from  around •25000 per project for market research and industry engagement up to around •100000  for production of prototypes and

increase the prospect of commercialization We emphasize that the purpose of such funding is not to fund spinouts for the entire journey from lab  to market but to help develop promising earlystage ideas to the point where they have been suf˜cient ly derisked to ˜nd traction and funding from the private sector This requires that the private sector  be suf˜ciently capable and incentivized to continue development which is likely to depend upon com plementary actions including other recommendations within this report We therefore recommend  that this program is closely monitored to ensure that the size of grants and appropriate and that the  stage of development of the technologies is suf˜ciently mature Moreover as institutional capacity de velops and as research staff develop greater entrepreneurial awareness and intent demand for the  fund is likely to increase Ongoing ME of the fund is therefore important and policymakers should  consider expanding the fund as appropriate EXPANSION OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER CAPABILITY  BUILDING PROGRAM The World Bank™s ‚Supporting Innovation in Romanian Catchingup Regions™ project has also piloted  grants for capacitybuilding programs within Romanian university TTOs We recommend an expansion  of this program Speci˜cally we suggest that funding should be made available to support the Roma nian National Network for Innovation and Technology Transfer ReNITT in developing and promoting  good practice and training courses Funding should also be provided to connect individual TTO staff  more closely with international networks such as the Association of Science and Technology Profes sionals ASTP and the Association of University Technology Managers AUTM in order to increase ex posure to good practice This should be done in conjunction with the recommendation above concern ing clari˜cation and awarenessraising of regulations relating to IP ownership and commercialization ENABLING BETTER USE OF RESEARCH     DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE One mode of collaboration between startups and other ˜rms and universities concerns the use of re search facilities and infrastructure Many universities possess signi˜cant publicly

this infrastructure has been catalogued 15  but remains poorly signposted to startups  and other ˜rms with a lack of clarity concerning the processes by which ˜rms may obtain access We  therefore propose a pilot accessibility program This pilot program would seek to identify suitable in centives for universities to share their infrastructure as well as identifying barriers for example  con

     OBJECTIVE   Attract international talent to mitigate existing ﬁbrain drainﬂ through a ﬁbrain gainﬂ approach       TARGET BENEFICIARIES   Romanian Startups       RATIONALE   As noted in the previous recommendation Romania suffers a ‚brain drain™ of talent As well as mak ing better use of the emigrant diaspora we suggest this drain should be countered through proactive  ‚brain gain™ measures aimed at attracting talent and other resources into Romania  Startup Visas also referred to as ‚Entrepreneurs Visas™ or ‚Innovators Visa™ are used by over 30 coun tries across the world to attract immigrant entrepreneurs who are deemed likely to contribute to the lo cal economy Typically such visas enable residency for a period subject to certain conditions   Š   which  may include an assessment of the feasibility of the applicant™s business idea and its potential scal ability sponsorship by an ecosystem enabler in the host country proof of suf˜cient capital or other  means to support themselves and any dependents and foreign language skills Some schemes also  apply criteria relating to the startup™s age investment or turnover a few schemes such as Lithuania™s  Startup Visa also limit startups to speci˜c technology sectors In some cases a Startup Visa converts  to a permanent residency visa if certain conditions are met  Several Startup Visa schemes extend to investors too For example Portugal™s Startup Visa offers a  fast track to foreign investors and their dependents from nonEU countries to obtain a Residence  Permit in Portugal To be eligible investors must invest •175000 into a business incubator including  •25000 of capitalization into the venture Investors are also required to work with a business incu bator for three years Harvey Law Group 2022 A few schemes such as that offered by Startup Chile  also aim to attract entrepreneurs from abroad to become mentors of local entrepreneurs and then  later aim to leverage these connections as an overseas network for growth In addition to Startup Visas numerous countriesŠincluding Romania The Romanian Parliament  2022   Š   offer a ‚Digital Nomad™ visa which typically targets remote workers including freelancers  These travel authorizations are relatively easy to obtain like tourist visas but allow longer stays and  permit visa holders to work during their stay provided they do so independently and remotely In or der to qualify for this visa workers must typically prove they will have regular income for the duration  Some countries such as Croatia and Italy offer tax exemptions or detaxation of all income generat ed to attract such workers Smartphone ID 2022 See Annex E List of Countries with a Startup Vi sas andor Digital Nomad Visas for a table of countries that provide immigration

APPROACH     We recommend a Startup Visa scheme to provide a simple fasttrack for immigrant entrepreneurs or  investors wishing to relocate to Romania  We suggest that development of a Romanian Startup Visa program should start with a review of in ternational examples to identify good practices However we suggest that an effective Startup Visa  scheme is likely to have Ł   Wellde˜ned policy objectives that clearly identify potential desirable spillovers from attracting  entrepreneurs  digital nomads  Ł   An assessment of the likely costs of the scheme with the ˜scal cost of incentives being system atically tracked and published This should also consider indirect effects such as what may hap pen if Romania enters a ‚bidding war™ race with other jurisdictions for talent Ł   Clear information about program that is provided to applicants in a userfriendly and accessi ble format Ł   A simple process for applicants Ł   An objective assessment process with clear guidelines for example a pointsbased assessment  that minimizes opportunities for assessors™ bias bribery or malfeasance Ł   Incentives that are clearly laid out in law and not negotiated on a casebycase basis Ł   Incentives that are linked to clearly de˜ned policy objectives Ł   ME mechanisms that can verify whether the policy objective of Startup Visa incentives is being  accomplished and can evaluate the costeffectiveness of the scheme Ł   Support and involvement from ecosystem enablers who are willing to assess applicants™ busi ness plans and sponsor applications Ł   Effective safeguards that prevent abuse In addition we recommend an expansion of the existing ‚digital nomad™ scheme because there are  likely to be spillover bene˜ts for startups arising from an increased concentration of highquality dig itally experienced talent even if such individuals are not entrepreneurs themselves Various studies  have shown that promoting such mobility stimulates an exchange of ideas that foster and encourage  economic growth 16  Other possible spillover effects include increased usage of online platforms which  can help push adoption within Romania        IMPLEMENTATION BODY   Implementation of this recommendation is likely to require collaboration between the Ministry of Re search Innovation and Digitalization the Ministry of Interior the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Ministry of Labor and Social Protection 16 One such study found that scienti˜c migration stimulates the quality of research and the biggest gainers from migration could  be the labs that attract people from different backgrounds and disciplines to create a dynamic team For more information see  Hunter Philip ﬁBrain drain brain gain or brain sharing New studies of the migration routes of scientists show that international  mobility bene˜ts all parties including countries that are net exporters of researchersﬂ  84 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  7 I MPLEMENT   A   STARTUP   VISA   PROGRAM       RISKS   There is a risk that the scheme could be abused by people seeking entry into Romania without genu ine entrepreneurial intentions There is a risk that the ˜rms created are low quality and do not create  economic impact or new jobs There is a risk that entrepreneurs are unwilling to relocate to a nascent  entrepreneurship ecosystem that is not yet conducive to scaleup of highgrowth ˜rms and startups  especially during a pandemic There is a risk that Digital Nomad visas do not result in the expected  knowledge spillovers        AMOUNT   Implementation and enforcement of a Startup Visa should not be much more expensive than other  visa types Costs of designing such a Startup Visa program and any specialized incentive schemes  are assumed to be up to •750000 This covers rapid benchmarking of other

 Romanian ecosystem enablers Romanian diaspora Successful Romanian founders as de˜ned by  ability to scaleup       RATIONALE   Human capital is vital for the development of startups However it is wellknown that Romania has  for several years suffered from a ‚brain drain™ with much top talent leaving the country In addition  the pandemic has dramatically accelerated remote working across the globe giving rise to new risks  of a ﬁvirtual brain drainﬂ whereby talent is remotely poached by overseas ˜rms and is thus unavail able to local startups However the presence of a large Romanian diaspora the ˜fth largest diaspora  group in the world also creates a signi˜cant opportunity a network that can support Romanian en trepreneurs in expanding overseas as well as potentially acting as investors and advisors Moreover  the globalization of talent also creates opportunities to gather ideas insights and best practices from  across the globe that can be applied to support the starting and scaling of ˜rms in Romania Success ful Romanian startups and Romanian diaspora have greater expertise exposure and networks than  the general population of Romanian tech startups 17   In addition there are opportunities to improve the visibility of Romanian startups and technology in  other countries Doing so will help raise the pro˜le of the ecosystem among potential customers in vestors and other ecosystem participants improving both market access and foreign investment into  Romanian startups See also the recommendations below concerning ﬁScaleup through exportsﬂ  these recommendations should be coordinated       APPROACH     We recommend the creation and curation of a new network of Romanian founders and diaspora that  connects with Romanian ecosystem enablers The initial core of this network may be identi˜ed using  existing databases of highgrowth startups including diaspora entrepreneurs and female entrepre neurs It may potentially also include prominent business leaders researchers investors and so on  17 This refers to a representative sample of tech startups by age region and sector that focuses on young digital and hightech  manufacturing businesses This subset comprises all ˜rms in Romania that are under ˜ve years old and are classi˜ed as digital  computer programming and software development and other digital and high technology manufacturing This dataset has a total  of 24502 ˜rms and a representative sample of 542 ˜rms was used in this survey The sample was strati˜ed by region Bucharest  metropolitan area Cluj Brasov and other regions and by sector core digital other digital and hightech manufacturing The sec tor de˜nition was informed by observing the predominance of similar activities in the PitchBookCB Insights data The sampling  frame was based on Lista Firme which has the contact information for all active ˜rms in the Romanian Business Registry FLAGSHIP  86 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  8 B UILD   AND   PROMOTE   A   NETWORK   OF  R OMANIAN   FOUNDERS   AND   DIASPORA The launch of this network should be supported by a widereaching marketing and communications  campaign leveraging use of tech blogs popular social media platforms and other media This network will require a clear value proposition for members to join as well as ongoing curation and  regular ﬁvalueaddingﬂ events in order to ensure it remains suf˜ciently attractive for members to re main involved We suggest that this may require testing or piloting in advance of the network™s crea tion but it may include networking events potentially hosted by local embassies or consulates op portunities to in˚uence Romania™s ambitious national startup support strategy media exposure and  opportunities to showcase successful startups at leading industry events for example Slush VivaT ech the Consumer Electronic Show  Members of this network should also be incentivized to participate in a Romanian ecosystem capaci tybuilding program The objective of this will be to bridge knowledge transfer gaps between ecosystem  enablers who lack access to critical resources and networks as well as developing a stronger culture  of ﬁgiving backﬂ which exists in many other successful ecosystems The network could for example  help identify experienced mentors for startups provide advice on exporting and overseas market con ditions help connect talent with ˜rms advise the startups fund see recommendation above and help  share good practice amongst angel networks and VCs Although mentors and advisors should argua bly be willing to provide their time  pro bono  as is the case in other ecosystems this is not yet an es tablished component of Romanian startup culture and so we recommend that compensation be pro vided to ensure their participation and commitment  Beyond building capacity for ecosystem enablers the network of successful founders and diaspora  may also act as an advisory group for policymakers wishing to develop future entrepreneurship poli cies and programs Again we suggest that consideration be given to compensation       IMPLEMENTATION BODY   We suggest that the implementation body for this reform is the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Tour ism The network itself could potentially be managed by one of the ecosystem enablers for example  the University of Bucharest given that many of the diaspora are alumni However it could also be a  standalone network with independent management       RISKS   A key risk is the willingness of successful Romanian founders and diaspora to join a network main tain involvement and participate in activities This may be mitigated to some extent through honorary  titles or compensation mechanisms Total Costs for Comprehensive Package of Reforms Activity Estimated Cost • Initial establishment of network of founders and diaspora 250000 Ongoing program curation for example network manager salary and of˜ce costs 350000  Program of events and activities including

digital startups grow and scale by widening their market opportunities       TARGET BENEFICIARIES   Startups seeking to expand into foreign markets       RATIONALE   The domestic market is too small for many innovative ˜rms so exporting is crucial in enabling them to  scaleup This recommendation focuses on improving access of Romanian startups to overseas mar kets through diplomatic missions and leveraging the Romanian founders and diaspora network see  recommendation above in critical markets  The domestic market for many digital startups is inhibited by low level of digital skills and limited use  of ecommerce platforms among the general public see also Recommendation 11 Unfortunately  export rates among Romanian ˜rms are also very low in comparison with other countries Many entre preneurs report being dissuaded from exporting because they do not understand the conditions and  culture in overseas markets and do not know where to start This is exacerbated by the underdevel opment of overseas networks by the lack of understanding of startups amongst trade attachés and  related civil servants and by a lack of appropriate skills and con˜dence amongst entrepreneurs There  is also a perceived lack of support from government and Romanian trade of˜ces abroad for startups  seeking to internationalize Furthermore many entrepreneurs report poor perceptions of Romanian  startups abroad which may present a further barrier to exporters  Fortunately there is evidence suggesting that once a ˜rm starts exporting further expansion into other  overseas markets is easier We therefore recommend that attention be focused on persuading Romani an startups to take their ‚˜rst step™ and begin exporting Other countries have sought to make this eas ier by providing overseas facilities where ˜rsttime exporters can ˜nd a ‚soft landing™ before developing  better local connections one example is Australia™s Landing Pads which is a network of physical loca tions in key markets that provide ˚exible of˜ce space and support in establishing local connections In addition there is a need for better strategic advice to startups as there is a tendency for Romani an ˜rms to target ‚aspirational™ markets such as Estonia rather than basing their choice of markets  on knowledge of existing trade links diaspora connections and so on  FLAGSHIP  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT NEEDED  89 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  9 S CALE   UP   THROUGH   EXPORTS       APPROACH     We propose a package of several measures Ł   It is recommended that policymakers start with an analysis of barriers to export for Romanian  digital startups and innovative ˜rms This should examine other startup internationalization pro grams to identify good practice identify critical markets and a strategy for ‚soft landing pads™  and understand the presence of and possible support from Romanian diaspora as per the rec ommendation above Such a study will inform the following actions Ł   Encouraging Economic Counsellors  Commercial Attachés within Romanian diplomatic missions  embassies and consulates located in key markets to promote Romanian startups for example  through specialized awarenessraising events involving highquality Romanian entrepreneurs and  key stakeholders from local startup ecosystems  Ł   Improving the reputation of Romanian startups through an annual showcase of leading ˜rms and  talent at global startup events This should include participation in reputable international events  or tradeshows such as Global Startup Award the Biotech Showcase TC Disrupt 4YFN Slush  etc 18  Funding should be made available for subsidized attendance at such events this could be  run as a public call open to individual entrepreneurs We also suggest that there may be value  in subsidizing enablerled ‚study missions™ to key markets This could potentially be an extension  of the existing Program to Support Internationalization of Firms PINT but should have a specif ic focus on highgrowth potential startups Ł   Domestic ﬁexport readinessﬂ program for startups This program would aim to increase the number  of exporting startups by providing basic information about the processes and regulations related to  exporting and the factors to be considered when entering foreign markets It would build upon the  analysis of export barriers to address key concerns or gaps in knowledge amongst startups The  program would also convey information about trade missions and other development activities  Ł   Piloting an international network of ﬁlanding padsﬂ These would be physical locations in key  markets for example United States east coast United States west coast London Tel Aviv Sin gapore   Š   to be determined by the study that provide ˚exible of˜ce space   Š   like a coworking  space   Š   for incoming Romanian startups Importantly the Landing Pads would have close links  to local Embassies in order to provide advice on immigration visas etc as well as local diaspo ra They would also seek to foster peertopeer interaction and learning between Romanian start ups located in the Landing Pad and may also run networking events to connect incoming start ups with Romanian expats Chambers of Commerce should also play a role here for example  creating campaigns to help startups export The strategy for the development of this network  should be developed as part of the ˜rst action we suggest that it might be appropriate to start  with a 2year pilot in 3 key locations which is then expanded        IMPLEMENTATION BODY   The implementation body for this reform includes the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Tourism Ministry of  Foreign Affairs Export Promotion Agencies the Department for Romanians Abroad Romanian Embassies   Diplomatic Corps in critical markets in coordination with the Romanian founders and diaspora network       RISKS   The key risk is coordination between the various ministries and agencies Additionally there needs to  be a

leveraging universities and research  and development institutes       TARGET BENEFICIARIES   Universities research and development institutes and startup founders       RATIONALE   The previous recommendation ﬁImprove Entrepreneurship Education and strengthen the role of Uni versities in the ecosystemﬂ sought to stimulate the supply of innovation from public research Howev er if this supply is not met with a corresponding demand from within the private sector then it is un likely to result in more innovations being brought to market This recommendation therefore aims to  encourage the demand side of innovation within the private sector which is currently relatively weak  in comparison with other European countries This recommendation is  not  intended to address the  wider gaps relating of technology adoption and nonRD innovation that exist within Romania which  we recognize as important but which are beyond the scope of this report  Despite large investments in RD infrastructure projects public sector investments are not translat ing into private sector innovation nor is there substantial demand from private sector ˜rms to build  upon the innovations of universities and research institutes As mentioned in the introduction and  discussed in depth in the interlinked  Output 1  report Romanian ˜rms are signi˜cantly less likely to in novate than the EU average Only 10 percent of Romanian ˜rms introduced a new or signi˜cantly im proved process or service in the previous twelve months compared with an average of 60 percent for  the EU Eurostat 2018 Moreover small ˜rms are especially unlikely to innovate in Romania Large  ˜rms are twice as innovative as smaller ˜rms whereas across the EU the difference is only 30 per cent The gap between Romanian ˜rms and their international competitors is seen in all types of in novation although it is especially large in the innovation of new products see ˜gure 64 In addition Romanian ˜rms have a low production of IP Romania has around 20 patent applications  per billion regional gross domestic product GDP in purchasing power standards PPS this contrasts  with Poland Croatia and Bulgaria each ˜ling over 30 patent applications per billion GDP and inno vation leaders such as Israel ˜ling over 140 patent applications per billion GDP European Commis sion 2020a One important reason for this is the lack of strong linkages between Romanian ˜rms and universities  Various measures of universityindustry collaboration and collaboration between innovative SMEs and  other organizations for example European Commission 2021b suggest that Romania lags its coun terparts in this regard This means that public sector investments in university research are not trans lated effectively into private sector patents and related innovations  FOUNDATIONAL  LONGTERM  TIME    SENSITIVE GOVERNMENT  SUPPORT NEEDED  92 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  10 I NCENTIVI Z E   INNOVATION   TO   FOSTER   KNOWLEDGE   SPILLOVERS   INTO   THE   PRIVATE   SECTOR       APPROACH     Various approaches to building linkages between research organizations and ˜rms are being trialed in  the World Bank™s ﬁSupporting Innovation in Romanian Catchingup Regionsﬂ program although most  of the interventions piloted in that program are ﬁsupplysideﬂ focused We suggest that several activi ties can be taken now to stimulate the demand side of this technology transfer including INCENTIVIZING RD IN EARLY˜STAGE FIRMS Existing RD incentives appear to be inadequate in stimulating the necessary activity in ˜rms and  are relatively limited in comparison with many EU countries Total direct government funding of busi ness RD as a percentage of GDP is well below the European average OECD and European Com mission 2021 As an example Poland allocated •3 billion of •3 billion in the last programming pe riod to business RD support  One important incentive mechanism is RD tax credits Current Romanian RD relief has remained  relatively unchanged in recent years and permits a deduction of 50 percent of costs However by com parison many other countries offer much more generous relief for example the United Kingdom RD  tax relief scheme permits a ﬁsuper deductionﬂ of 230 percent of qualifying RD costs for SMEs We  therefore recommend an expansion of RD relief  However although RD tax credits are effective at stimulating RD Bloom Grif˜th and Van Reenen  2002 such schemes still require that ˜rms to fund the RD themselves prior to claiming relief This  incentive is thus more helpful for scaling ˜rms than for driving RD in young startups and other ˜rms  that are not yet revenue positive As was discussed in the Policy Mix see Part One of this document  section 235 there is already a bias in the existing mix of instruments towards mature pro˜table  ˜rms Increasing RD tax credits are unlikely to correct this bias and may exacerbate it  For this reason we recommend that an expansion of RD credits be accompanied by direct grant  funding for RD targeted speci˜cally at startups and small ˜rms   Š   which as noted in Part One of this  FIGURE 64    Innovation Performance by Type of Innovation Source

INNOVATION   TO   FOSTER   KNOWLEDGE   SPILLOVERS   INTO   THE   PRIVATE   SECTOR report are often not the primary target of existing instruments Such grants should be developed with  consideration to the various recommendations in Part One for example they should have speci˜c fo cused objectives low administrative burdens for applicants low bureaucratic burdens for adminis trators a clear logic for the intervention and robust instrumentlevel evaluation This is likely also to  require an expansion of the institutional capacity to distribute such funding In addition the grants  should be coordination with the startup investment fund see recommendation above ‚Create a startup  fund™ because as previously noted grants and equity investment may displace each other to a degree  Because costs for grants and tax reliefs will depend both on the exact design of the instruments the  de˜nition of qualifying RD and the uptake by ˜rms we recommend that new instruments are pilot ed for a limited period in order to gauge demand with budget allocated for a comprehensive evalua tion of the schemes ENCOURAGING CONSORTIA FOR COLLABORATIVE  RESEARCH Many countries encourage collaborative research between ˜rms and research organizations using  collaborative research grants which are restricted to collaborative partnerships or consortia Such  collaborations are known to encourage the exchange of both explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge  with university collaborations being associated with innovative newtomarket products Belderbos  Carree and Lokshin 2004 Chun and Mun 2012 Larger research consortia may also be particular ly helpful in reducing coordination failure and in stimulating ‚precompetitive™ research or other re search of low appropriability that is dif˜cult for any one ˜rm to capture for its own competitive advan tage   Š   meaning that there is a reduced incentive for any one ˜rm to invest in its production even if it  bene˜ts the sector as a whole We suggest that collaboration formation and consortium formation should be encouraged through the  creation of a new collaborative research grant scheme explicitly requiring the involvement of at least  one university partner and at least one private sector ˜rm ideally an SME The scheme could initial ly be targeted towards solving speci˜c societal challenges such as climate change or sustainability  for which open calls for proposals are invited Responding consortia or partnerships should be led by  a private sector ˜rm in order to ensure a focus on commercial applications We suggest that universi ty partners should still have their costs funded at 100 percent and that private sector partners may  potentially receive a subsidy of their eligible costs depending on the ˜rm size and the nature of the  project As with the action above this is likely also to require an expansion of institutional capacity in  order to administer the scheme  ESTABLISHING KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER  SECONDMENTS We recommend that technology and knowledgetransfer both explicit and tacit is further promot ed through the public funding of knowledge transfer secondments Such a scheme would subsidize  the secondment of members of academic staff into a ˜rm for a duration with the speci˜c purpose  of encouraging knowledge transfer It could potentially also operate in reverse   Š   that is subsidizing  the movement of an industry researcher into a university or other research institution Secondments  would be timelimited but tailored to the needs of the ˜rm For example secondments under the Knowl edge Transfer Secondments KTS scheme funded by the United Kingdom™s Engineering and Physical  Sciences Research Council EPSRC may last between 6 weeks and 2 years Proposed secondments  should be appraised by a panel including senior academics to determine the quality and feasibility  94 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  10 I NCENTIVI Z E   INNOVATION   TO   FOSTER   KNOWLEDGE   SPILLOVERS   INTO   THE   PRIVATE   SECTOR of the proposed project and the likely business impact that may result from knowledge transfer The  scheme could potentially be managed at the subnational regional level Establishment of the scheme  will need to address regulatory issues within universities that may inhibit the mobility of researchers INNOVATION VOUCHERS The recommendation above proposes a scheme to encourage Universities and other research organ izations to make available their research equipment and infrastructure To complement this we pro pose a scheme targeted at startups and other ˜rms to subsidize the cost of research relating to the  use of these facilities This would take the form of an ‚innovation voucher™ which would use public  funds to pay for a portion of RD costs in quali˜ed research organizations We suggest that the val ue of the voucher should be relatively small with the application process for vouchers being relative ly ‚lighttouch™ to encourage their adoption for example the vouchers could pay for up to •10000 of  facilities use and accompanying academic expertise We suggest that a proportion of matched fund ing should be requested from ˜rms using the vouchers in order to prevent abuse       IMPLEMENTATION BODY   The Ministry of Research Innovation and Digitalization   Š   although some of the recommended actions  could be administered regionally This should also be implemented in coordination with the bodies re sponsible for the Startup Fund       RISKS   Key risks include lack of good quality ˜rms because many ˜rms are pursuing opportunity entrepre neurship Other risks include lack of coordination between several public authorities because the in novation agenda is fragmented across several entities including UEFISCDI        AMOUNT   The following costs are tentative  Activity Estimated Cost • Pilot program for enhanced RD tax reliefs for startups and scaleups 50 million Direct grant funding of startups and young SMEs for example grants of •100000 x 10 ˜rms per  year x 8 regions x 7year period 56 million Grant programs for collaborative research consortia for example grants up to •500000 x 20  per year nationally x 7  70

ECONOMY       OBJECTIVE   Create a domestic market for startups by promoting use of digital products services and platforms       RATIONALE   Many highgrowth startups are digital However Romania ranks 27th of 27 EU Member States in the  2021 edition of the Digital Economy and Society Index DESI with low internet use and digital skills  inhibiting the domestic market for digital ˜rms  While Romania ranks highly on connectivity 10 th  in the DESI for this component it ranks lowly on  most indicators measured by this index including being 25 th  on Integration of digital technology in busi nesses™ activities with only 17 percent of SMEs selling online and only 33 percent of SMEs having at  least a basic level of digital intensity and 26 th  on human capital with only 31 percent of individuals  having basic digital skills compared to EU average of 56 percent 10 percent of individuals having  above basic digital skills compared to EU average of 31 percent and 35 percent of individuals hav ing at least basic software skills compared to EU average of 58 percent and 6 percent of ˜rms offer ing ICT training Firms and consumers are thus unable to make the most of the opportunities afford ed by digitalization and ecommerce still less the next wave of digital innovation relating to ﬁWeb3ﬂ  protocols and distributed ledger technology       APPROACH AND ESTIMATED COSTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF REFORMS   This recommendation is divided into four speci˜c subcategories The total costs for each subcatego ry are listed in the table below Activity Estimated Cost • Category 1 Promoting ecommerce

Activities under this intervention could take a long time to develop because they are linked to other  factors While use of ecommerce platforms accelerated during the pandemic uptake of digital tech nologies could remain super˜cial and Romania may not fully bene˜t from productivity transforma tions needed for ˜rm recovery Developing skills to consume digital technologies and building trust in  digital systems are also longerterm activities FOUNDATIONAL  LONGTERM  TIME    SENSITIVE GOVERNMENT  SUPPORT NEEDED  97 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  11 P ROMOTE   THE   DIGITAL   ECONOMY       KPIS   Romania™s performance across various pillars of the Digital Economy is measured annually and pub lished in the Digital Economy and Society Index DESI An overarching outcome is Romania™s im proved ranking on this index COMPONENT 1 PROMOTING E˜COMMERCE PLATFORMS       OBJECTIVE   Increase Romania™s use of transactional technologies visàvis uptake in use of ecommerce platforms       TARGET BENEFICIARIES   Firms selling online and customers buying online       RATIONALE   Romania™s rates of ecommerce   Š   buying goods and services online   Š   are the lowest in Europe Be cause ecommerce is a transactional technology HallwardDriemeier et al 2020 it has the poten tial to improve the inclusion of smaller ˜rms including startups and reach new markets in rural and  remote areas Though use of ecommerce increased somewhat as a result of COVID19 the address able domestic market for many ˜rms remains limited        APPROACH     The government can promote use of ecommerce through education and capacitybuilding pilot thus  building the domestic market for many startups There should also be a more coherent voice for ecom merce within government because at present it is unclear where responsibility resides It is also rec ommended that Romania conduct an indepth analysis on the ecommerce landscape to identify reg ulatory bottlenecks We note that in Qatar the Ministry of Transport and Communications launched  an ecommerce portal to serve as a central resource for information communication and support for  both merchants and shoppers  Policymakers also need to consider whether Romania™s current physical infrastructure as opposed  to digital promotes physical connectivity between regions and counties The quality of physical infra structure impacts business logistics including shipping logistics for ecommerce       IMPLEMENTATION BODY   The implementation body for this activity is the Ministry of Research Innovation and Digitalization in  coordination with the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Tourism        RISKS   Romania may not fully bene˜t from productivity transformations needed for ˜rm recovery because  consumption of digital products and services is linked to digital skills and usage of other digital plat forms including ˜nancial services As re˚ected in Romania™s DESI ranking Romania ranks poorly on  percentage of population with basic and above

consumers who lack basic or above basic digital skills digital startups indirectly       RATIONALE   Romania has serious digital skills gaps societally and in the workforce Less than one third of peo ple aged between 16 and 74 have at least basic digital skills 56 percent in the EU as a whole while  some 3 percent have basic software skills EU average 58 percent European Commission 2021a  Increasing digital literacy will increase the addressable domestic market for digital startups as well  as producing a wide range of other bene˜ts such as improving productivity and expanding access to  digital services The low uptake of platform technologies including ecommerce highlights the real ity that the diffusion of even basic transactional technologies is not automatic even with the high ac cess to broadband internet Users™ digital literacy and the availability of digital skills matter because  they determine the extent to which users turn to platform technologies and the extent to which start ups are able to ˜nd domestic markets HallwardDriemeier et al 2020       APPROACH     We recognize that there have been numerous studies of the issue of digital skills both from the World  Bank Group and other organizations for example Melhem and Jacobsen 2021  We are also aware  that the Authority for the Digitalization of Romania is coordinating efforts to improve digital skills and  we underscore the importance of this Following the recommendations of the World Bank Group report  Europe 40 Addressing the Digital Dillemma  HallwardDriemeier et al 2020 we suggest address ing digital skills at multiple levels In primary and secondary education students should be exposed to  basic coding and other digital skills as early as primary school The Romanian Education board should  update tertiary education curricula to meet changing skills requirements for example including an  understanding of ﬁWeb3ﬂ technologies   Š   see Lentini and Gimenez 2019 and World Bank 2020a  99 P OLICY  R ECOMMENDATION  11 P ROMOTE   THE   DIGITAL   ECONOMY for more detailed analysis of future skills needs Universities can ensure that their curricula remain  relevant with guidance from the advisory council for educational reforms suggested in Recommenda tion 6˙Given the pace of technological change lifelong learning opportunities should be supplied for  all ages and should include not only technical skills but also skills for adaptability  One example of how to encourage basic skills development in society is seen in Estonia which estab lished the National Estonian Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition to decrease the digital skills gap by focus ing on programs that can train large portions of the population in digital skills The coalition includes  policymakers service providers and information technology IT training companies It has developed  selffunded and largescale training initiatives that aim to lessen the digital skills gap The purpose of  these activities is to lower the number of people in Estonia that do not use computers or the Internet to  5 percent European Union 2021 Estonia is also embedding digital skills at within primary and sec ondary education to ensure that future workforce is equipped with basic and above basic digital skills       IMPLEMENTATION BODY   The implementation body for this activity is the Ministry of Research Innovation and

technologies 20  to contribute to the development of Romania™s digital economy       TARGET BENEFICIARIES   SMEs       RATIONALE   Managerial practices are important for digitalization harnessing the bene˜ts of digital technology  needs complementary capabilities and the ˜rms that bene˜t the most from digital technologies are  those that also have better access to key technical managerial and organizational skills OECD 2019a  Low managerial quality lack of ICT skills and poor matching of workers to jobs curb digital technology  adoption and hence the rate of Andrews Nicoletti and Timiliotis 2018 IT is complementary to man agement practices and that because small ˜rms typically have worse management practices the  impact of IT may be less for such irms Bloom Sadun and Van Reenen 2012 In short ˜rms that  have better management practices are more prone to adopting digital technologies and doing it faster       APPROACH     The government should pilot a managerial skills training alongside digital education for SMEs to in crease Romanian ˜rms™ productivity The government can also introduce incentives for collaboration  among ˜rms such as through vouchers for innovation In the case strengthening managerial capabil ities to drive performance leveraging digital technologies incentives should address the main barri ers for managers to drive ˜rmlevel digitalization namely preferences and behavioral bias information  constraints weak external and internal incentives need of complementary investments coordination  problems and lack of trust Therefore programs should on the one hand encourage the assimilation  and demand of digital technologies through focusing on managerial capabilities and on the other sup port the supply of digital technologies for entrepreneurs  managers Simultaneously public interven tions should generate enabling conditions for ˜rmlevel digitalization Overarching programs typically  facilitate tailored assistance and often provide ˜nancial support for entrepreneurs Hence overarch ing programs provide tools for complementary investment both managerial and ˜nancial Main types  of interventions include a managerial capability  digital maturity assessment tools conducted by  an expert andor selfassessed to access tailored support designing and deploying business plans  etc b provision of ˜nancial support such as vouchers and grants for managerial upskilling software  upgrading test new digital technologies technical assistance and business advisory services and en abling conditions for digital

DETAILED FINDINGS OF THE FUNCTIONAL  ANALYSIS   D1   PROGRAM ORIGIN The program origin indicator refers to the formal pro cesses through which an instrument was created  The origin of a policy instrument must be embedded  in processes covered by the rule of law and consistent  with the general highlevel goals for which it is intend ed as an intervention The identi˜cation of the problem  being addressed and the means to address it must be  grounded in actual evidence through a systematic and  rigorous appraisal of the issue and the options to reach  the goals set to address it The scores for this indicator are close to best prac tices for this small set of Romanian instruments  See  ˜gure AD1 As noted earlier most of these instruments  are funded by the operational programmes OPs and  developed as part of the formal operational program  process The downside of this is that on occasion the  external origin of the program appears to have in˚u enced other design features Best Practices  Ł   If the program is a continuation of another program it must be adapted to the current circumstances and  this improvement should be based on a reasonable diagnosis and evaluation of the previous version of  the program F IGURE  AD1   Distribution of Program Origin  Scores Source  World Bank Group Note  A score of 5 indicates best practice CONTENTS   D1   Program Origin˛   ˛ 108   D2

program justi˜cation indicator refers to the pres ence of speci˜c diagnostics of the particular market  or system failure that an instrument is intended to ad dress  The justi˜cation should be detailed in program  documentation and reports and provide an analysis or  sensible estimation of the size or intensity of the failure  and the impacted population Justi˜cation scores are midrange or less except for  two instruments  The diagnosis of market or system  failure can be improved and the evidence for it when  mentioned could be more speci˜c It is one of the in dicators with both a midrange average and standard  deviation as re˚ected in the distribution below ˜gure  AD2 Several instruments can improve on this issue  The rationale for some instruments may not be ground ed in known systemic failures  Some interviewees reported that the primary reason that an instrument exist ed was because of the direction of the EC rather than having themselves identi˜ed a particular systemic failure Best Practices Ł   Diagnostic that covers all the aspects of the market or system failure with evidence and rationale for the  need of the speci˜c intervention    D3   PORTFOLIO RELATIONSHIP The portfolio relationship indicator analyzes how a program operates in relation to all other related and rel evant programs˛Š˛at both the national and the European level  The scoring on this indicator includes potential  con˚icts complementarities or overlaps with the rest  of the policy mix A coherent science technology and  innovation STI policy mix is characterized by dynamic  and complementary policy portfolios For example a  policy portfolio that supports innovation in companies  may have instruments that target companies at differ ent stages of development with complementary instru ments as companies evolve in capabilities size market  presence and so on Several instruments receive good practice scores  See ˜gure AD3 The fact that the instruments are  proposed within the OP and the consideration of their  relevance in the OP portfolio explains the good perfor mance observed There are some instruments whose  role in the policy mix may be suboptimal  Best Practices Ł   Instrument design should include a diagnostic analysis of potential con˚icts complementarities or overlaps  with the rest of the relevant programs F IGURE  AD2   Distribution of Program Justi˜cation

competitiveness knowledge crea tion and so on  These objectives should be measura ble and achievable with concrete targets Several instruments score at or below midrange large ly due to lack of measurable objectives at the system  level  See ˜gure AD4 Many instruments specify ob jectives in terms of project or bene˜ciary achievements  rather than the overall effects of the instrument on the  innovation system or economy Some instruments spec ify objectives in terms of activities or products of pro jects rather than changes in the Romanian innovation  system Several instruments also have mixed or un clear objectives Best Practices Ł   Objectives should be clear and measurable with concrete targets  Ł   Objectives should be explicitly tied to the system level changes expected from the intervention    D5   ALTERNATIVE INSTRUMENT The alternative instrument indicator is closely tied to  program justi˜cation in the sense that it evaluates  whether di˚erent approaches were considered that  can tackle the identi˜ed failure that an instrument is  intended to address  Cost tradeoffs between alterna tive instrument designs should be considered Where  approaches based on international examples are be ing copied the designs should be adapted with consid eration of the local context and capacity of national im plementing bodies  Many instruments did not consider alternative models  of intervention for the stated objectives  The scores  for the consideration of an alternative instrument show  considerable variability with an average below midrange  ˜gure AD5 Best Practices Ł   A highscoring program on this indicator should have included a coherent consideration of different ways for  government intervention considering both national and international practices  Ł   A

MODEL The logic model indicator measures whether programs  have an explicit logic model that connects the inputs  outputs and expected outcomes of the program with  clear and measurable indicators  The logic model 23   should be well articulated and the expected results  should be feasible Logic models should be updated  regularly as programs evolve over time Most instruments in Romania lack a logic model  See  ˜gure AD6 Romanian instruments consistently score  worst on the logic model indicator The logic of interven tions is articulated at the OP level which is required by  the European Commission EC and is also sometimes  present at the level of individual projects but not at the  actual intervention level This ties into the weaknesses  in instrument objective setting and outcomeimpact in dicators that are discussed below  Best Practices Ł   The highest score on this indicator is given to instruments with full explicit logic model with high quality  components  Ł   If an explicit logic model does not exist at least an implicit one does and Ł   The logic model is used and updated regularly   D7   INPUTS The inputs indicator measures whether program in puts are explicitly de˜ned and consistent with a log ic model  They should cover all resources needed to  implement the program including administrative and  operational costs Costs should be monitored through out the implementation phase  There is only one instrument in Romania that has an  above midrange score on inputs  See ˜gure AD7  Cataloging that exists is incomplete and focused only  on obvious resources It is of little value to compute ad ministrative costs at the instrument level  Best Practices Ł   A highscoring instrument on this indicator is one where all inputs including administrative costs have been  clearly identi˜ed and budgeted inside the logic model  Ł   Inputs include all or most of the resources needed to achieve the objectives 23 Also known as a logical framework ﬁlogframeﬂ

cataloged and are consistent with the logic model  Activities should be consistent with inputs and outputs  that is all activities have a purpose and help to reach  the desired outputs There are two issues with activities in Romania  One  is that many activities needed to implement instruments  are not considered in the design and planned in advance  The second issue is that many instrument activities are  confused with those bene˜ciaries are expected to car ry out in projects The scores for activities have larger  variability See ˜gure AD8 Best Practices  Ł   Instruments with full and explicit catalog of all necessary activities for achieving the desired objectives Ł   Activities are consistent with inputs and outputs that is all activities have a purpose and help to reach the  desired outputs    D9   PRODUCTSOUTPUTS The productsoutputs indicator measures whether all program outputs and products have been explicitly iden ti˜ed  They should be consistent with all activities and outcomes in order for the desired results to be achieved  All outputs should be operationalized and measurable  The overall scores for products and outputs are a bit  higher in Romania because most of the indicators that  are actually speci˜ed are product indicators  See ˜g ure AD9 Their connection with outcomes and impacts  are not always well articulated  Best Practices Ł   A highscoring instrument on this indicator should  have explicit and complete identi˜cation of prod ucts related to its logic Ł   Their relation to outcomes and impact should be  explicitly stated  Ł   Productsoutputs of activities are operationalized  and measurable   D10   MAIN BENEFICIARIES The main bene˜ciaries indicator focuses on whether the bene˜ciaries targeted in the project design are con sistent with the overall logic of the instrument  Beyond that they should also be speci˜ed in such a way that  can maximize the program ef˜ciency Criteria for targeting and quantitative measures should be provided in a  transparent manner  In Romania bene˜ciaries are well de˜ned but poorly targeted  The selected instruments score around the mean  or above on this indicator see ˜gure AD10 In all cases bene˜ciaries are well de˜ned but maybe missing either  clarity of their justi˜cation or optimal targeting What is generally missing is speci˜c tailoring of the bene˜ciaries  F IGURE  AD8

coherent with the objectives Ł   There should be a clear strategy for reaching the  target group effectively    D11   SELECTION CRITERIA The selection criteria indicator refers to whether selection criteria are consistent with both the objectives and  the logic model of an instrument  The design of the selection criteria should be such that it will lead to the maximum  potential impact on the targeted population The criteria should be transparent simple and easy to understand  Instruments in Romania include information about  selection criteria in their design but the information  needs to be more detailed  The scores on this indica tor are also midrange and up See ˜gure AD11 The  instruments included in the design at least some spec i˜cation of what would have amounted to a good appli cation submission by potential bene˜ciaries The ones  that score higher included more detailed criteria to use  later in the assessment of proposals  Best Practices Ł   The selection criteria with the highest scores are  those that are clear and coherent  Ł   They should lead to reaching the population with  greater impact  Ł   The criteria should be transparent simple and  easy to understand   D12   AUDIENCES The audiences indicator refers to whether all impor tant program stakeholders can provide input into the  instrument design and instrumentation process  There  should be formal mechanisms in place for stakeholders  to provide input into instrument design and implementa tion Instruments should account for nonbene˜ciary stake holders and their role for the success of the instrument  Several scores on this indicator are on the higher end  showing that there are clear mechanisms for stake holder consultations for many instruments in Romania  See ˜gure AD12 The ones with lower

connected to desired changes at the system level  They should also be connected to meas urable results and assessment indicators Impact indicators should be integrated in the broader policy context on  a country or regional level Criteria should be included  for tracking the evolution of outcomes that allow for end ing program participation if it becomes clear that pro gram objectives will not be met as opposed to ad hoc  closure at the end of a contract or other extrinsic rea son not related to results Many instruments in Romania lack measurable and  coherent impact indicators  The overall score of the  selected instruments for expected outcomes and im pacts is the second lowest for any indicator observed  in the functional analysis with an average of 233 see  ˜gure AD13 The main problem arises from the lack  of measurable and coherent impact indicators An un derlying issue is that the absence of a logic model leads  to a lack of connection between outputs and outcomes  Best Practices Ł   The expected outcomes and impact should be explicit coherent observable and measurable Ł   They should be integrated fully with other policies inside and outside the sector Ł   They should be used as a performance measure  Ł   Criteria are included for tracking the evolution of outcomes that allow for ending program participation if it  becomes clear that program objectives will not be met as opposed to ad hoc closure at the end of a con tract or other extrinsic reason not related to results   D14   MONITORING AND EVALUATION DESIGN The monitoring and evaluation ME design indica tor checks whether there is an integrated ME sys tem embedded in the design phase of the instrument  See ˜gure AD14 The indicators chosen should be high  quality operationalization of outcomes and impacts  Data collection methods must be realistic and in cas es when external data is used adjustments should be  made to guarantee that the system would meet the spe ci˜c needs of the instrument If ME for the instrument  relies on external ME systems adjustments or accom modation of the system must be made to ˜t the specif ic needs and aims of the instrument to avoid distorting  the

operationalizations of outcomes and impacts and are not to be confused  with indicators of activities or outputs Ł   Realistic methods of data collection have been considered for the measurement of indicators   D15   LEARNING The learning indicator refers to formal learning pro cesses used for systematic improvements of instru ments  Learning processes should be used to improve  instrument design and implementation procedures with  systematic and formal documentation of the changes  being made Learning is happening in Romania but it is not be ing documented systematically or formally  See ˜g ure AD15 The scores on this indicator are in the mid range and slightly above There was evidence of learning  and adjustment from experience and a certain level of  documentation of what was learned There was no fully  implemented knowledge management system though  Best Practices Ł   The bestscoring instrument on this indicator should apply the learning process in the design of the instru ment with systematic and formal documentation used for longterm improvement    D16   SOLICITATIONS The solicitations indicator refers to the processes for  launching calls for proposals and whether they are rea sonable and consistent with the logic model and ob jectives  Adjustments on subsequent calls for proposals  should be welldocumented and made with full justi˜ cation aligned with the program objectives Where ap propriate calls should be published regularly and have  consistent predictable calendars In Romania the scores for solicitations show high varia bility with some

application Information indicator focuses on the eligibility criteria set to reach the  target population  They should be clear and transparent and all needed information should be publicly available  Selection information should be collected and analyzed including lists of applicants scores awarded to submit ted proposals and other pertinent information related to the submission and selection process This information  should be made available to applicants as much as general privacy regulations allow The dissemination of infor mation on eligibility and selection and is consistent with the target population should be appropriate  In Romania lower scores on eligibility criteria and ap plication information re˙ect di˝cult or burdensome ap plication processes  The score for eligibility criteria and  application information is one of the lowest in the imple mentation area at 278 but shows great variability see  ˜gure AD17 This means as we see in the distribution  that several instruments have above midrange scores  The lower scores re˚ect a dif˜cult or burdensome applica tion process that may require that applicants seek exter nal help such as external consultancies or agents to sat isfy the application requirements which imposes a cost  Best Practices Ł   Instruments with transparent selection process coherent with the target group Ł   Instruments where the gathered information is used to improve and adapt future selection criteria Ł   The candidates selected and the amount of money assigned to them are known to the public and Ł   The administrative burden does not lead to a need for additional resources to submit applications   D18   APPLICATION AND SELECTION PROCESS The application and selection process indicator refers  to the mechanisms for project selection used by the  implementing body which should be agile transpar ent and responsive  The committees responsible for  award decisions should be composed of relevant inde pendent experts appointed in a justi˜ed and transpar ent manner The mechanism for appealing award deci sions should be accessible and clear  The average score of this indicator is from the mid range and higher

the presence of database systems that track par ticipants projects followups outputs and other data relevant to the program  The system should be used to  make adjustments of the solicitations themselves increase responsiveness to participants™ concerns and con tribute to the general improvement of management and design of the program and should be usable by other  programs across the portfolio In Romania Instruments mostly rely on the centralized data system but it is not clear how well the system  is tailored to the speci˜c needs of each instrument or whether the information in the central database was  used to its full extent  See ˜gure AD19 The program  database indicator has a high average score but also  high variability re˚ecting some unevenness in the con sistency with which information about the progress of  projects was either available or used by the instrument  managers They mostly rely on the centralized data sys tem which contains all project information and report ing The degree to which it was tailored to the speci˜c  needs of each instrument was not clear in all cases In  addition it was not clear whether the information from  the program database was used to its full extent in un derstanding how to make adjustments to the instrument  or the solicitations  Best Practices Ł   The best scoring instruments should have information and a follow up system in place and the data gathered  should be used in order to improve the performance of the program  Ł   The system is used to make adjustments to the calls themselves to increase responsiveness to participants™  concerns and to contribute to the general improvement of program management and design It is also usa ble by other programs    D20   PROJECT CLOSURES The project closures indicator

D22   PROGRAM MANAGEMENT The program management and organization quality indicator looks at whether the organizational structures  in place are appropriate for administering the instruments  The organizational structure should ensure minimi zation of external and internal pressures in the implementation of the program and should be reviewed for func tional adequacy given changing requirements with new policies and instruments  In Romania using a division of labor based on manag ing authorities MAs and implementing bodies may  impose costs  The management and organization qual ity indicator has a bimodal distribution with two pro grams having perfect scores and the rest midrange or  below See ˜gure AD22 The higher scores are due  to the involvement of institutions such as the European  Economic Area EEA and Norway Grants Program that  carry out the implementation of the instrument The rest  are housed in the ministries under regular public ser vice regimes As required by the OP some use a division  of labor involving MAs and implementing bodies that  are not always aligned with needs of the instrument  Although interviewees generally reported that this divi sion of labor was usually wellhandled it seems clear  that this structure imposes some costs and inef˜cien cies on the overall process Best Practices Ł   The organizational structure does not have too many levels that make it dif˜cult for information to ˚ow to the  implementers Ł   The organizational structure ensures minimization of external and internal pressures in the implementation  of the program Ł   The

place regard ing program implementation  The implementing body  should have the capacity to introduce changes and be  capable of resolving con˚icts and responding to signi˜ cant changes in the political or economic environment  Romania exhibits mixed performance on this indica tor  This indicator also shows a bimodal distribution in  part due to the same reason given before higher scores  for the involvement of foreign implementers but also  due possibly to different internal arrangements running  collections of instruments see ˜gure AD23 Some of ˜ces are run better than others and

sta˚  This includes assessing whether the number of staff is  adequate to implement the program  Romanian instruments scored from the bottom to the  top  This indicator has an enormous variability with an  average score of 3 exactly in the middle See ˜gure  AD24  The heterogeneity in the perceptions of op portunity for skill enhancement and the adequacy of  the staff and skills may be due to local conditions with in the ministries Some of these issues are dif˜cult to  gauge with videoconferencing interviews that do not al low for direct observation of the work conditions Some  instruments did not seem to have enough skilled staff  nor many opportunities for improving their own staff  Others thought they were suf˜cient  Best Practices Ł   The bestperforming instruments on this indicator have staff with exceptional experience and highquality  educational background and Ł   There are formal training opportunities and incentives for advancement F IGURE  AD24   Distribution of

A NNEX  D   D25   INCENTIVES The incentives indicator refers to the presence of clear  and explicit criteria for assessing sta˚ performance  Awards and punishments should be linked to clear es tablished criteria and related to the individual™s duties  and the performance of the instrument  The average score on the incentives for performance  and their relation to the instrument outcomes is low  and re˙ects a separation of the sta˚ performance  evaluation from the performance of the instruments  they manage  See ˜gure AD25 Staff performance fol lows standard hierarchical procedures with evaluations  down the chain of command by the direct supervisor  However several staff commented that performance  management was ﬁall stick and no carrotﬂ Best Practices Ł   Instruments are managed by staff that are being evaluated based on wellspeci˜ed criteria The management  has clear mechanisms for rewarding good and punishing bad performance tied to the successful achieve ment of program goals    D26   PROCESS MONITORING The process monitoring indicator checks for the pres ence of an audit and monitoring system with clear  indicators for monitoring program implementation  This system should be applied periodically and reports  should be submitted and presented to higher authori ties Monitoring should aim for effective oversight with out becoming oppressive Except for the two instruments with higher scores most  are in the midrange or below  See ˜gure AD26 The  latter group of instruments are subject to the standard ized audit procedure on a national level Simultaneous  audits seem to be problematic That is to say in some  cases the lower scores were due to the perceived bu reaucracy of too much monitoring rather than too little Best Practices Ł   Instrument subject to robust administrative process monitoring with quality measurement of indicators  Ł   The process should appear periodically and inform timely decisions from management F IGURE  AD25   Distribution

generate impact evaluations  The information should be collected at all indica tors levels and the latter should be improved with time There must be an impact assessment as well as mech anisms for learning and adapting the program Programs should be revised based on implementation lessons  The implementation of ME has high variability and an average score above the midrange  See ˜gure AD27  This is partly due to the instrument managed by a foreign agency that has a perfect score The rest of the scores also  seem high when compared to practices in peer coun tries using similar ME infrastructure More emphasis  was put on the existence of the centralized digital infra structure than on speci˜c ME practices for continuous  improvement This score is probably overvalued  Best Practices Ł   The best performing instrument should have a for mal highquality ME program that operates con tinuously and is used to modify programs and gen erate impact evaluations  Ł   Information is collected for indicators at all levels  activities products etc Indicators are adapted  and improved with time Ł   Programs have been revised based on implemen tation lessons   D28   PROGRAM COORDINATION  The program coordination indicator refers to wheth er a program acknowledges the existing portfolio of  STI programs and has established good coordination  and communication with other programs  In cases  when overlaps occur they should be resolved as pro grams are combined or coordinated Explicit comple mentarity criteria should exist for the overall effective ness of related programs  The Romanian agencies manage collections of instru ments within the OP and have builtin mechanisms  of coordination among them  As a result the average  score is relatively high above the midrange See ˜gure  AD28 There was not much clarity about the strategic  signi˜cance of this coordination mechanism  Best Practices Ł   The bestperforming instruments are those that acknowledge the existing programs and have established  good coordination and communication Ł   In cases when overlaps occur they are resolved as the programs are combined or coordinated  Ł   Explicit complementarity criteria exist for the overall effectiveness of related programs F IGURE  AD27   Distribution of ME  Implementation Scores Source  World Bank Group Note  ME  monitoring and evaluation F IGURE  AD28

institutional coordination indicator refers to coordination and participative mechanisms with other pub lic and private institutions  Evidence of joint work with other institutions should be in place  In Romania the coordination of institutions is a prod uct of the similar mechanisms among MAs and im plementing bodies that are required by the OP  See  ˜gure AD29 The question of how this coordination  results in improvement of design for future cycles tak ing into consideration synergies and complementari ties remains unclear  Best Practices Ł   The best performing instruments are those that  have established formal coordination mechanisms  with evidence of collaborative work and design  Ł   Joined and coherent strategic management should  be present  Ł   There needs to be evidence showing that work  and joint design processes take place with other  institutions   D30   INTERACTION OF JURISDICTIONS AWARENESS The internal interaction of jurisdiction rules and regulations indicator refers to the implementing sta˚™s knowl edge of laws and regulatory constraints  Programs should be adapted based on jurisdictional limitations and  program staff should be capable of taking action to lev erage positive or mitigate negative factors  For the most part program managers are aware of  jurisdiction rules that a˚ect the potential for perfor mance of the instruments they manage  See ˜gure  AD30 Stateaid regulations are especially problem atic and dif˜cult to work around  Best Practices Ł   The best scoring instruments are the ones where  the implementing body is fully aware of and  acknowledges the jurisdiction interactions  Ł   The best scoring instruments are the ones where  the implementing body has taken action to adapt  the program based on the jurisdiction rules and  regulations for optimal performance  F IGURE  AD29     Distribution of Institutions  Coordination Scores Source  World Bank Group F IGURE  AD30     Distribution of Interaction of  Jurisdictions

jurisdiction rules and regulations seriousness of external constraint indicator refers to  the degree to which the general legislative and regulatory environment inhibits program implementation and  e˚ectiveness and the degree to which any regulatory obstacles are modi˜able  For some instruments in Romania the stateaid reg ulations were a di˝cult obstacle to overcome as re ˙ected in the instruments with lower scores  See  ˜gure AD31 Except for those run by a foreign or ex ternal agency the ones with higher scores may re˚ect  a misperception of how the obstacles work simply ac cepting conditions uncritically Those scores seem too  high given experiences elsewhere in the region  Best Practices Ł   Degree to which general legislation or regulation  can leverage the program impact Ł
