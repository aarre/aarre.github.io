Technology is a potent driver of productivity and economic growth—and it is also
reshaping Europe’s labor landscape. This report delves into the transformation
that technology is causing within European firms, changing their tasks and the
skills they require. It discusses options and explores solutions for
policymakers on how to craft a future where technology’s rewards are inclusive,
benefiting every level of European society.
