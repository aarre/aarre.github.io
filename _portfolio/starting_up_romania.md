 Successful entrepreneurs require resources (such as infrastructure,
 capital, human capital, and knowledge), which together constitute an
 entrepreneurship ecosystem. Entrepreneurship ecosystems are essential
 to business creation and growth because access to these resources,
 along with factors like capital availability, regulations, and social
 capital, significantly impacts an entrepreneur's success. The report
 focuses on Romania's entrepreneurship landscape, noting challenges
 such as a lack of high-growth and innovative businesses,
 underutilization of human capital despite a high number of science
 and engineering graduates, and gaps in supportive policies and
 institutions. It proposes improving the quality of entrepreneurship,
 enhancing the policy mix for innovation and digitalization, and
 strengthening institutional capabilities as key
 strategies. Additionally, the report draws on extensive data sources
 to analyze Romania's startup ecosystem, including cross-country
 comparisons, firm-level data, and surveys. It identifies regional
 variations and suggests tailored policy recommendations to foster
 more impactful entrepreneurship across the country. The ultimate goal
 is to refine strategies and support mechanisms that can effectively
 nurture entrepreneurship in Romania.
