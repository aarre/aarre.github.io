         On the other side, these dominant firms could also innovate less as lower competition reduces incentives to innovate, leading to lower
         productivity growth (Gutierrez & Philippon, 2020; Gutierrez et al. 2019), a scenario that could be defined as “inefficient concentration”

XVI   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
              During the last 15 years, technological progress has advanced at an impressive rate. For example,
              the computational capacity of the fastest computers has multiplied by 100, and the number of
              parameters in the most advanced AI systems by 10,000.6 Although advances in cutting-edge
              technology do not translate immediately into changes in the production process, the number of
              firms adopting technology has also experienced an increase in the last years. As shown in Figure
              1.1, the number of industrial robots installed yearly in the manufacturing sector in Europe, Asia,
              and the Americas increased significantly between 2010 and 2019. A similar increasing trend can
              be found in private investment in AI companies. This increase is strongest for United States,
              leading with an investment amount equal to the eightfold and threefold of EU’s and China’s AI
              investments in 2021 (Figure 1.2).

                      The era following the Great Recession saw a rise in technological advancements that led to a
                      decline in middle-skill jobs, which had already been happening since the 1970s due, among other
                      reasons, to offshoring. This resulted in a marginal increased income inequality in many EU countries.
                      Figure 1.4 illustrates changes in productivity and income inequality across EU member states from
                      2008 to 2019. During this period, many EU countries experienced a slight increase in inequality, as
                      measured by the Gini coefficient on household disposable income, with minimal changes in labor
                      productivity. As a result, gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates in the EU remained low due
                      to stagnant productivity. EUROSTAT reported an average yearly GDP growth rate of 1.3 percent in
                      the EU-27 between 2008 and 2022, with GDP per capita growing below 1 percent per year during

             There has been a heated discussion surrounding the paradox of growing inequality and stagnant
             productivity amid rapid technological advancements. Cusolito and Maloney (2018) have reviewed
             this issue extensively. One theory is that the paradox may be attributed, in part, to a rise in
             market concentration. A few dominant firms, which seem less productive and innovative, have
             been acquiring smaller startups with high potential. Autor et al. (2020b) indicate that the decline
             of income’s labor share in various advanced economies could be explained by the impact of
             technological progress and globalization on market concentration.

 4       THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
1.1	     Conceptual framework linking technology, firms, and labor markets
         Technological development is linked to growth and income distribution via firms and labor markets.
         Technology can increase productivity, profits and the size of firms. If technology is adopted only
         by a relatively small number of large firms, it can increase market concentration and reduce the
         share of national income going to labor, exacerbating distributional tensions. Technology can also
         change how total labor income is distributed among workers with different levels of education.
         This section develops a simple framework linking technology and labor markets through firms,
         their production processes, the tasks involved in such processes, and ultimately the demand for
         workers’ skills. The framework underscores the importance of the skills provision system, which
         includes the formal education system, vocational education, and short-term training courses or
         ALMPs, to determine the supply of skills. The labor market interaction between the demand and
         supply of skills determines the effects of technology on the wages and employment of different
         workers. Figure 1.6 shows the linkages between technological progress, firms, tasks, skills provision
         systems, and labor market outcomes analyzed in this report.

1.1.1	   A taxonomy for different technologies
         This report classifies technologies on two dimensions according to their purpose, and maturity.
         (See Box 1.1 for more details.) In terms of purpose, building on the World Bank report “Europe
         4.0” (Hallward-Driemeier et al. 2020), we distinguish between informational and operational
         technologies. Technologies are also different in terms of their maturity across technological waves.
         AI, 3D printing, and cloud computing are called “4th Industrial Revolution” technologies (Bowles
         2014; Frey and Osborne 2017; UNIDO 2020). Some researchers argue that “4th Industrial Revolution”
         technologies could affect labor demand in a way that is unique and distinct from earlier waves of
         industrialization (Webb, 2020; Autor 2022).




                                                                                      TABLE OF CONTENTS      5
    BOX 1.1. A taxonomy for distinguishing among different technologies analyzed in this report
    First, our taxonomy draws on Hallward-Driemeier et al. (2020), who recognize that different technologies solve different
    problems. The authors classify technologies according to their purposes and how they achieve efficiency gains:
     ·	 Informational technologies exploit the falling price of computing power and harness the exponential growth of
        data to provide improved and customized products and services at lower costs.
     ·	 Operational technologies lower costs by automating processes that workers previously executed.9
    Second, we expand Hallward-Driemeier et al. (2020)                  TABLE B1.1.1. Technology classification
    by classifying technologies based on their ‘maturity.’

             Innovations in technology can stem from a variety of
             factors, including advancements in scientific knowledge,                                technologies to boost
             production processes, and the introduction of new products                              productivity, lower costs,

             quality of the regulatory environment. Firms are motivated
             to adopt new technologies because it typically improves                                 creation, destruction, and
             their productivity, reduces costs, or enhances the quality of                           modification of tasks,

9 We slightly depart from Hallward-Driemeier et. al. (2020) by classifying Internet of Things (IoT) as an informational and not an operational
  technology. IoT refers to devices that collect and exchange data and can be remotely controlled over the Internet (Eurostat, 2021). Thus, its pri-
  mary function is data exchange and management. More importantly, our analysis suggests that IoT has characteristics that are more similar
  to other informational technologies than operational technologies (such as low investment costs).
10 The First Industrial Revolution (beginning of 19th century) epitomizes the transition from manual production to use of steam- and water

  power-driven machines. The Second Industrial Revolution (end of 19th century) introduces mass production and assembly lines enabled by elec-
  tricity. The Third Industrial Revolution (in the 1970s) is characterized by automation through electronics and IT, whereas the Fourth Industrial
  Revolution connects the physical and digital spaces into a cyber-physical system (UNIDO, 2020).




6         THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
          We follow Acemoglu and Autor’s (2011) framework and define jobs as collections of tasks—specific
          activities or functions that workers perform. As in Acemoglu and Autor (2011), “skills” are the
          abilities, knowledge, and expertise that workers have and use in performing tasks. Technology’s
          effect on the demand for skills operates via its impact on tasks.

          Deming (2017) shows that the US market is increasingly rewarding social skills because teamwork
          has increasing relevance, and there is little scope for substituting social skills with an algorithm.
          Acemoglu and Autor (2011) find that unpacking the task contents of jobs is useful for analyzing the
          distributional impact of technologies. To analyze the potential impact of technology on tasks and
          skills we follow Deming (2017) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and define jobs in terms of their task
          content, distinguishing between six types of tasks: (1) nonroutine cognitive analytical, (2) nonroutine
          cognitive personal, (3) routine cognitive, (4) routine manual, (5) nonroutine manual (physical), and
          (6) social tasks. (See Box 1.2 for a detailed explanation of the relationship between jobs and tasks.)

                                   whereas it is lowest in the elementary occupations, plant and machine operators, craft-related
                                   trades workers, and agricultural workers. The intensity of routine cognitive tasks is highest for clerical
                                   support workers, whereas the intensity of routine manual tasks is highest for plant and machine
                                   trade operators. Nonroutine manual tasks are more common in agricultural workers and in plant and

standardized value of the six task types defined in Box 1.2 for the nine major groups (1-digit) of the ISCO 08 classification.
These groups are: 1 = Managers; 2 = Professionals; 3 = Technicians and associate professionals; 4 = Clerical support workers;
 5 = Service and sales workers; 6 = Skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers; 7 = Craft-related trades workers; 8 =
Plant and machine operators, and assemblers; 9 = Elementary occupations. The values are standardized to have a mean of
            zero and a cross-occupation standard deviation of one for the 126 3-digit occupations in ISCO 08.

11        Just as any summary measure, they may not capture nuances in occupational classifications and may have certain biases. For instance, the
         measures are increasing in the number of tasks performed in the job—which implies that more complex jobs that involve multiple tasks may have
         a higher intensity across all types of tasks than more basic jobs, where only a few tasks are performed. In this sense, the measures are better
         used to compare different occupations along a same task dimension, rather than comparing several task dimensions for the same occupation.

1.1.3	      Education systems and the supply of skills
            Adapting education and training systems to put more emphasis on skills that will be in demand
            in the digital era have been highlighted as a core area for reform. (See, for example, Autor et al.
            2022a). Concluding a systematic evidence review, Hötte et al. (2022) note that “effective up- and
            reskilling strategies should remain at the forefront of policy making along with targeted social
            support systems.” Policies to enhance the supply of skills that reflect changing demand due to
            technological transition typically fall into two categories. First are educational policies that affect
            endowments people bring to markets (which Rodrik and Stantcheva (2021) call pre-production
            policies). Second are active and passive labor market policies aimed at workers already on the
            market but possibly unemployed (production stage policies). Our analysis of the skills provision
            system focuses on pre-production polices—notably the capacity of upper-secondary VET systems
            to provide the necessary skills in a technology-driven and globalized European labor market.

            The interaction between a technology-driven rapid change in the demand for skills and a relatively
            rigid supply of skills determines the labor market equilibrium (wages and employment—the middle
            part of Figure 1.6). Private sector firms typically have incentives to adopt new technologies quickly,
            despite barriers (such as financing, regulations, and human capital). Education systems usually lack
            the incentives and the flexibility to change their curricular contents and supply of training courses
            to reflect changes in labor demand (see Box 1.3). In the short run, this makes the demand side of
            the labor market more elastic or responsive to technological changes vis-à-vis the supply side.



 BOX 1.3. Adapting the supply of VET courses in Greece
 The evidence of VET schools’ efforts to track their students’ post-graduation success and employers’
 satisfaction with their performance is limited. According to the results of the Training Assessment Project (TAP)
 survey12 conducted in vocational (apprenticeship) schools managed by the Greek Public Employment Service (DYPA),
 preparing students for the world of work and developing a demand-driven approach to training are two areas for
 further improvement.13 Forty-eight percent of VET schools do not track their students’ employment paths after
 graduation, and 62 percent do not track their performance in the workplace. Most surveyed schools (64 percent)
 responded that they do not offer their students career guidance or counseling services, contradicting the idea that
 vocational schools need to adequately prepare students for the labor market. DYPA and the Ministry of Education
 and Religious Affairs (MoERA) are developing tracking systems for VET graduates.
 Even though new specializations have been introduced, interviews with school directors of VET schools in
 Greece reveal that many trades have not changed over the last 20 years. Most occupational profiles and curricula
 are not up to date. According to the TAP survey, 32 percent of the schools surveyed do not have an annual process for
 reviewing and closing low-performing programs. Curricula for most technical occupations taught in Greek vocational
 schools have not been updated since 2007. The Organization for the Certification of Qualifications and Vocational
 Guidance (EOPPEP) has started developing new accredited profiles for a few occupations in demand and is also
 planning to develop new-style job profiles over the next couple of years. The national mechanism for diagnosing labor
 market needs is used to an extent; however, it remains a significant challenge to better align the supply of skills in
 VET with labor market developments.



12 A survey developed by the World Bank Group and specifically under the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) Initiative.
  It aims to identify the conditions and common practices under which technical and vocational education and training institutions operate
  as well as those conditions and practices that are associated with quality instruction and positive employment outcomes. More information
  about the survey can be found here.
13 The survey was carried out in August 2022, under the technical assistance project “Modernizing Vocational Education and Training Services

  of DYPA in Greece”, Administrative Agreement of August 30, 2021 – EC Contract No REFORM/IM2021/029.

                                                     thinking, problem solving, and social skills.

          Our analysis of the skills provision system focuses on the capacity of upper-secondary VET
          systems to provide the necessary skills in a technology-driven and globalized European labor
          market. Two arguments justify our focus on pre-production policies, particularly upper-secondary
          VET systems. First, much of the discussion on the supply of skills related to the “future of work” has
          concentrated on “production policies” in the form of ALMPs (Autor et. al. (2022c); OECD (2019)).
          To our knowledge, our report is the first to assess the adequacy of secondary VET systems for a
          technology-driven, dynamic labor market. Second, the role of VET in skill development in the EU
          is crucial not only for the labor force as a whole but for those from a disadvantaged background.
          Nearly half of the EU’s upper-secondary students are enrolled in VET, the highest share in the
          world. In all the EU member states, VET students tend to be from lower socioeconomic status and
          show lower cognitive foundational skills as measured by the OECD’s Program for International
          Student Assessment (PISA) test. So, in the EU, making sure the VET systems provide graduates
          with the skills needed in a globalized and technologically driven labor market is critical. Despite
          our strong focus on upper-secondary VET, our policy section (Chapter 5) includes a discussion on
          alternatives to providing skills for the current workforce through ALMP.


1.2	      Rage against the machine
          William Lee, an English clergyman, invented the first stocking frame knitting machine in 1589. The
          machine revolutionized the process of knitting stockings, making it quicker and more efficient than
          traditional hand-knitting methods. Despite the machine’s significant importance and Lee’s innovative
          breakthrough, Queen Elizabeth I declined to grant him a patent to safeguard his invention, possibly
          delaying the Industrial Revolution and all its benefits by a few decades. The Queen’s argument was
          simple yet common among politicians of her and our time: “Think about what this invention could
          do to my poor subjects. It would undoubtedly lead them to ruin by taking away their jobs and leaving
          them with no choice but to beg for their livelihood” (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012).

          Several years later, after the knitting machine was patented, the textile industry underwent a
          significant transformation, marking the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Queen Elizabeth’s
          concerns were not unfounded, and many textile workers lost their jobs as a result. A group of
          radical workers, calling themselves the Luddites, formed an organization in Nottingham with the
          aim of destroying the new textile machines and burning down emerging factories.

         The impact of technology can be disruptive and displace certain workers, but so far, the existing
         evidence does not support the claim that technology will permanently reduce employment.
         Although technology can accomplish tasks once done by humans, displacing workers, it can also
         complement them. This shift can be challenging for those directly affected, but technology can also
         enhance the work of humans and create new jobs, leading to increased productivity and economic
         growth. Studies have shown that after an initial adjustment period, new jobs are created and
         overall employment levels usually remain stable (Autor, 2015).

1.2.1	   Taking uncertainties to a new level
         Although past predictions of a future without human work have yet to realize, some of the
         most recent technological innovations have raised these old concerns to a new level. New
         automation technologies’ characteristics make them fundamentally different from earlier waves
         of technological progress. AI, in particular, is capable of carrying out tasks that do not follow
         a specific rule, considerably widening the set of tasks it can perform. Many tasks that were
         considered safe from automation, such as those focused on the creation of new original content,
         are now at risk of automation. The recent introduction of ChatGPT, a free online generative AI
         tool, has increased awareness among the general public of both the vast potential and the deep
         concerns associated with these technological breakthroughs. Newer, improved forms of AI—such
         as adaptive AI—will likely further polarize this dichotomy. As pointed out by Autor (2022) these
         new automation technologies raise questions that are virtually impossible to answer, generating a
         new level of uncertainty around what the future of work will look like. Predictions about the future
         are always speculative, but AI is making this exercise more uncertain than ever.




                                                                                             TABLE OF CONTENTS          11
          Some observers consider the capacities of AI to be so vast as to threaten the existence of human labor.
          Many worry that as AI—and its integration with robotics—increasingly substitutes for human labor in
          cognitive-intensive tasks and, in a possibly not so distant future, in socioemotional-intensive tasks, it
          will ultimately make human labor (mostly) redundant. Although potentially beneficial for humanity’s
          welfare, this extreme scenario would also cause an unprecedented disruption in our societies. If not
          effectively governed the transition to this new equilibrium—“the End of the Age of Labor” (Korinek &
          Juelfs, 2022)—may result in a major deterioration of the social order. Although this scenario remains
          extreme and impossible to predict with any certainty, governments and societies should prepare for
          this eventuality. The debate on how to best accompany this transition and on how to best design
          this possible new equilibrium is growing. Although different approaches are being discussed, including
          implementing universal basic incomes (Yang 2021), guaranteeing a just society in the face of such
          epochal changes would require some radical rethinking of our current social contracts.

                                     If the (quasi)complete substitution of human labor is ultimately only one

                                     is not the first time that a new technology has changed the task content
on multiple factors,                 of human labor. As mentioned in Box 1.4, there exists a significant time
making exposure                      gap between the introduction of technological advancements and their

                                     make sure the costs and gains of these changes are equitably distributed
                                     among the members of society.

 BOX 1.4. Exposure to new technology does not translate automatically into adoption of new technology
 Findings by Frey and Osborne (2017), based on the susceptibility of jobs to computerization, suggested that nearly
 half of all jobs in the US might be at risk of being replaced in the next decades. Their finding received considerable
 attention in the media downplaying the fact that being exposed to a new technology does not translate into that
 technology being adopted. We analyze the relationship between first exposure to technology in 2000 and adoption
 among firms 20 years later for two technologies—AI and industrial robots.
 To identify firms and workers potentially exposed to technology we rely on Webb’s technology exposure measure
 (2020). Webb’s (2020) index measures exposure for AI and industrial robots at the occupational level in 2000. We
 correlate this measure with information from the EUROSTAT ICT Survey on actual adoption of AI and industrial
 robots in 2020. We study the relationship between exposure and adoption using all sectors for AI and using
 manufacturing only for industrial robots. An important caveat in this exercise is that, whereas exposure is measured
 at the occupational (that is, worker) level, technology adoption is identified at the firm level. Given the substantial
 discrepancy in the share of firms and their respective share of employment in the economy, the estimate is bound
 to be relatively less precise.
 Our main finding is that worker-level exposure to technology aggregated to the industry level is not related to the
 share of adopting firms in a country-sector 20 years later (Figures B1.4.1 and B1.4.2). The relationship between
 exposure and adoption for both AI and industrial robots is slightly negative but not statistically significant. Although
 Webb (2020) and other exposure measures can give predictions on the potential for technology adoption, they are
 an imprecise predictor of actual adoption. Actual adoption is a product of “exposure” and complementary drivers of
 adoption, such as those that we discuss further in Chapter 2. Exposure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition
 for adoption.

14   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
2.1	Introduction
               This section presents evidence on patterns of adoption of different technologies. To assess what
               impact technology can have on labor markets, it is important to discuss the pattern of adoption,
               and how different firms across regions and sectors adopt different technologies. Our analysis is
               based on Italian firm-level micro data and EUROSTAT data at the country-sector level.

               We focus here on multiple technologies ranging from more novel ones, such as big data analysis
               or Internet of Things (IoT) or 3D printing, to more established ones, such as ERP and CRM.
               Technologies are different, and therefore we independently analyze their adoption patterns and
               drivers. To structure our analysis, we use a taxonomy that classifies technologies according to their
               purpose and maturity (see Box 1.1).



2.2	           A large share of firms in the EU does not adopt modern
               technologies

               A large share of firms in the EU adopts no digital technologies. Based on the Italian firm-level
               data we find that about one-third of firms with over 10 employees14 adopt none of the six digital
               technologies analyzed, and another third adopt only one technology, whereas only 15.2 percent of
               firms adopt more than three technologies (Table 2.1). Basic information software—ERP and CRM—
               is the most widely adopted form of technology, followed by cybersecurity software and other
               forms of more advanced information technologies, such as cloud computing, Internet of Things,
               and big data analytics (Figure 2.1). Less than 5 percent of firms adopt robots and 3D printing
               technologies, two operational technologies that are used primarily in the manufacturing sector.
               Augmented reality, arguably the most advanced information technology among those included in
               the ICT 2017 survey is also the least adopted one, with only 1.4 percent of firms using it.


               “A full one third of all firms in the EU do not adopt any digital technologies”

               Different rates of adoption across technologies are due to various reasons. First, the sectoral
               scope of a technology matters because some technologies such as industrial robots have such
               a narrow scope that they can be used only in specific sectors such as vehicles and motor parts,
               whereas others such as ERP/CRM are broad technologies that used across most sectors. Second,
               the fixed costs of adoption differ significantly, and with recent advances of software as a service
               (SaaS) technologies such as ERP or CRM, have small fixed costs for adoption. Finally, maturity
               differs across technologies, augmented reality for example is a novel technology for which limited
               applications exist and businesses are less familiar with them compared to more established ones
               such as ERP or CRM.

            The large share of firms not using ERP and CRM software suggests that there is ample room to
            improve overall productivity at a relatively low cost by promoting a more widespread adoption of
            these basic information technologies among firms in the EU. Although ERP and CRM are the most
            adopted technologies, 47 percent of firms with more than 10 employees adopt neither of them.
            These technologies can improve the organizational efficiency of virtually any firm by improving
            strategic planning and promoting a more efficient management of the day-to-day business
            activities.

            At the same time, these relatively basic and increasingly cheap technologies apply to virtually any
            sector. Similarly, although these types of software might still show economies of scale that make
            them more attractive for bigger businesses, their pricing is usually linked to the size of a company
            and its consumer base, making it affordable for smaller firms.15 The large share of Italian firms
            not using even essential software for business planning and consumer management which can
            improve productivity at a small cost raises the question on the drivers of the relatively limited
            adoption of these technologies. This can help identify how policies can effectively ease any existing
            constraint to their adoption.

            The results from Italy are confirmed by the country-level data from EU27+ with two main
            differences. First, the levels of technology adoption across EU27+ on average are even lower than
            in Italy, and the most adopted technology is cloud computing instead than ERP/CRM, which ranks
            second and third, respectively (see Figure 2.2).


15 In
    particular, the possibility of purchasing CRM and ERP as software as a service (SaaS) through the cloud and paying a subscription fee that
 depends on the number of users and functions adopted allows the firms to implement these in a modular manner and drastically reduces
 their fixed costs.

2.2.1	                          Firms adopt different technologies following a hierarchical structure
            Data from Italy show that firms adopt different technologies following a hierarchical structure. Figure
            2.3 shows the average level of technological sophistication—measured as the number of technologies
            adopted—of firms adopting each of the eight technologies considered in the analysis. The graph
            provides insights into the hierarchical structure of technology adoption decisions. ERP/CRM and
            cybersecurity are the first two “entry-level” technologies being adopted by firms with low technology
            sophistication. Firms with a medium level of technological sophistication start to adopt cloud, IoT,
            robots, and 3D printing at high rates relative to the average among all firms, whereas augmented reality
            is adopted primarily by firms with high technological sophistication. These patterns reinforce the idea
            that ERP and CRM are easy to adopt, requiring limited pre-adoption technological sophistication.
            Because they have a wide scope of applications across sectors, these technologies can benefit a
            wide range of firms. By contrast, robots and big data analysis are adopted primarily by firms with
            higher technological sophistication and often narrow sector-specific uses. Two factors are likely to

             relative to Northern Europe, is close to convergence to the technology frontier, which is due to its
             high exposure to foreign direct investment (FDI) from Western Europe over the last three decades.

18       THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
             Regional within-country differences in the level of technology adoption are also large. The stark
             within-country differences in technology adoption makes Italy an ideal case-study capturing
             much of the variation across EU member states (see Box 2.1). In Italy, firms in Lombardia and
             Emilia-Romagna—two regions with important advanced manufacturing sectors—lead in terms of
             overall technological complexity. Firms in these regions adopt on average 1.4 of the technologies
             covered in the ICT 2017 survey (Figure 2.5). By contrast, firms in the southern regions of Sardegna,
             Basilicata, and Abruzzo show the lowest level of technological sophistication, adopting on average
             less than one of the eight ICT 2017 technologies. Italian firms in the north of the country have a
             technological advantage in all but one of the eight surveyed technologies.16 Regional adoption gaps
             tend to be larger for manufacturing technologies, a fact in part determined by the stark regional
             differences in the distribution of advanced manufacturing.

     BOX 2.1. Italy as a case study for EU-wide analysis
     Regional differences in economic development within Italy are large and are a good proxy for differences across EU
     countries. The Italian economy is far from homogeneous across the country’s territory, with marked and persistent
     regional differences in economic development that mimic those observed across the EU. In 2019 GDP per capita—in
     purchasing power parity (PPP)—in the richest Italian regions was close to those of the richest country in the EU (with
     the exception of Ireland and Luxembourg), whereas GDP per capita in the poorest Italian region (Calabria) was only
     slightly higher than that of Bulgaria, the EU country with the lowest per capita income. Quantitatively, these regional
     differences are thus a good proxy for the differences between EU countries, making Italy an interesting representative
     case study for the EU economy.

     The levels of technology adoption by firms in Italy are in line with the EU average and heterogeneous across regions.
     The average level of technological sophistication among Italian firms is close to the EU average, with Italian firms
     adopting on average 1.08 of the seven technologies considered in this chapter compared to the 1.09 of the average
     EU firm.17 The adoption rates by technology are also close to the EU-wide adoption rates, but Italy lags in the
     adoption of big data analytics. Relative to the dispersion in PPP GDP per capita, the regional dispersion in technology
     adoption tends to be lower compared to the EU cross-country dispersion in adoption rates but are in line with the
     cross-EU dispersion in the adoption of industrial technologies. Overall, although exceptions still apply, the patterns
     of technology adoption among Italian firms suggest that Italy is a good representative case study to analyze the
     adoption of technologies by firms in the EU.




17The seven technologies are ERP, CRM, Internet of Things, big data analytics, cloud computing, robots, and 3D printing. The main analysis in
 the chapter combines ERP and CRM because these two technologies were surveyed together in the Italian 2019 Enterprise Census.

                Evidence based on micro-level firm data from Italy confirms that operational technologies are
                common in manufacturing, whereas services lead in the adoption of more advanced information
                technologies—ICT is the industry with the highest level of technological sophistication. Manufacturing
                leads in the adoption of 3D printing and robots, two operational technologies clearly linked to
                production activity of manufacturing firms. Sectoral gaps in adoption remain relatively small for
                ERP/CRM and cybersecurity, three technologies that can have a widespread application across
                sectors. ICT is the most technologically advanced sector, leading, in particular, in the adoption of
                advanced information technologies. Perhaps surprisingly, the financial sector lags in the adoption
                of standard information technologies. Only 16.5 percent of financial firms interviewed in the 2019
                census declared that they used a CRM or ERP software and only 8.5 percent declared to use a
                cybersecurity software.18

2.3.3	          Larger and younger firms adopt more technology
                Larger firms adopt more technology. The adoption gap between
                small and large firms is larger for more advanced technologies with a
                potentially higher scope for economies of scale. Operational technologies
                have a large adoption gap, with large firms adopting robots and 3D
                printing 7.5 and 5.7 times more often than small firms (see Figure
                2.7). The adoption gap in these technologies is to be expected. Relative                                                           ‘‘There are
                to information technologies, robots and 3D printing have higher fixed
                installation costs, which can be justified only when these technologies

                are used at scale, making them not cost-effective for small businesses.                                                            persistent gaps

                enterprises is particularly large for technologies that require large initial
                investments or skilled human capital. The adoption gaps between large-                                                             adoption in favor
                and medium-sized and small enterprises tend to persist over time.                                                                  of larger firms”

18The low percentage of firms using cybersecurity software is particularly surprising given the high cybersecurity risk faced by financial insti-
 tutions. Part of this result could be explained by a widespread use of external services to ensure the cybersecurity of these firms, a practice
 that might not be well captured by the ICT and census questions.




22        THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
                   Other things equal, younger firms have an advantage in the adoption of more advanced
                   information technologies. Older firms tend to adopt more often operational technologies, a fact
                   in part explained by the larger size of mature firms. Except for augmented reality—which is still
                   a niche technology—the age gap in technological adoption disappears for advanced information
                   technologies. The size adoption gap in Figure 2.7, panel a and the positive correlation between
                   size and age show that, other things equal, younger firms have a comparative advantage in using
                   advanced information technologies. This underscores the importance of promoting the entry of
                   new startups in technologically sophisticated sectors to promote the overall technological upgrade
                   of the private sector.

2.3.4	             There is ample space to increase technology adoption, especially among small firms in the EU
                   An annual survey among 12,800 firms in the US and EU by the EIB found that 80 percent of firms
                   in the EU in 2022 have adopted new technologies, compared to 88 percent in the US. However,
                   these average gaps mask compositional differences that are important to highlight. Whereas
                   large companies are everywhere more likely to embrace new technologies, there is no significant
                   difference in adoption rates between large EU and US firms. The adoption rate difference between
                   the EU and the US emerges more clearly among micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)
                   and is larger for smaller firms. In the US, technology adoption rates are 67 percent for micro firms
                   and 69 percent for small firms, whereas in the EU, these rates are 53 percent and 61 percent,
                   respectively (Figure 2.8). To narrow the digital divide between the EU and the US, policymakers in
                   the EU could promote the uptake of new technologies especially focusing on small and micro firms.
                   Large firms may have benefitted disproportionately from new technologies adoption in the last
                   decades, contributing towards increased market concentration (see Box 2.2 Technology adoption
                   and market concentration in the EU).

 BOX 2.2. Technology adoption and market concentration in the EU
 A growing literature has suggested that during the last decades firm-level market power has increased significantly
 as measured by markups and profitability. This expansion of market power comes with a reallocation of market
 shares toward larger firms (De Loecker et al., 2020; De Loecker and Eeckhout, 2021). Although various factors
 could be driving this expansion, technology could play a key role. Increasing technology adoption by larger and
 more productive firms can have profound consequences for competition and the rise of superstar firms (Autor
 et al., 2020b), especially because technology adoption has productivity benefits (Tambe et al., 2020). Technology
 adoption also allows for higher scalability of production (Lashkari, Bauer & Boussard, 2022). Thus, if mostly large
 firms can adopt and disproportionately benefit from new technologies, over time, this is likely to increase divergence
 in economic outcomes between large and small firms. To test this hypothesis, we examine the relationship between
 sectoral market concentration and a sector’s technological intensity. Using large enterprise shares across country-
 sectors, Figure B2.2.1 presents the results for all technologies and points toward some evidence that those country-
 sectors that are characterized by higher concentration, measured by a larger share of large enterprises, are also the
 ones that experience higher levels of technology adoption. The partial correlation coefficient (after controlling for
 time-invariant country and technology characteristics) is large at 1.93 and statistically significant.

 The results from the Italian firm-level analysis also point to the risk that technology adoption could increase
 market concentration. The data shows that firms that are bigger and more productive are more likely to adopt
 new technologies. They also show that after an adoption event, firms adopting new technology grow faster both in
 terms of size and productivity. These two effects combined lead to a mechanical increase in market concentration,
 with bigger firms adopting more and becoming even larger relative to their competitors. The relationship between
 adoption and market concentration thus underscores the risks that a high concentration of technology adoption
 among a few firms can have for markets and consumers. Policymakers must design efficient policies to address
 this risk. Making sure markets are contestable, antitrust laws are well enforced, promoting the entry of innovative
 startups that can challenge market leaders, and providing incentives for technology adoption among small firms in
 lagging regions are essential steps in this direction. We return to the discussion on technology adoption and market
 concentration in Section 3.3.

 2.4	           Determinants of technology adoption
                Understanding drivers of adoption is key for policy makers to prioritize investments and interventions
                that can expand adoption toward smaller firms and those that have been excluded from the
                benefits of technological progress. As pointed out in Box 1.4, the fact that the activity performed
                by a firm is exposed to a technology does not imply that that firm will adopt that technology.
                Adoption decisions are based on a cost-benefit analysis as firms evaluate net expected returns
                of adopting versus non-adopting. Several factors change the net returns of investments in new
                technologies and thus influence the extent to which exposure translates into actual adoption. This
                section discusses some of these factors. Some relate to the environment in which firms operate,
                whereas others relate to the firms’ characteristics and their capabilities.

              The availability of human capital enabling the productive potential of new technologies is an
              important driver of adoption. Adopting a new technology when the skills needed to properly exploit
              it are not readily available is likely to be a poor investment. Although firms can in principle transfer
              these skills to their workers through on-the-job training, learning takes time and comes at a cost.
              The capacity of an educational system to prepare its workforce to efficiently use new technologies
              can thus reduce their adoption cost.20 The existing economic literature has made this point clearly
              and provided evidence that basic cognitive or foundational skills such as numeracy, literacy, and
              problem solving determines the workers’ capacity to use effectively new technologies and innovate
              (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2008). The capacity of an educational system to equip students with
              skills needed in the labor market, including foundational skills, are important drivers of technology
              adoption (Machin & Van Reenen, 1998; Autor et al., 2003). Our analysis across EU countries is
              consistent with this evidence. Measures of the availability of math and science skills and digital
              literacy among a country’s population are positively correlated with technology adoption in the
              following years, and this correlation is stronger for information technology.

              Adopting a new technology often requires paying large upfront setup costs, making the availability
              of reliable and affordable sources of financing a key enabling factor. A large body of empirical
              literature exists on the relationship between specific measures of financial constraints and
              technology adoption. For example, Midrigan and Xu (2014) find that lack of financing distorts
              firms’ technology adoption decisions. The efficiency of the financial system determines which
              technologies will be adopted (Cole et al., 2016). Further, the existence of markets providing capital
              for high-risk endeavors can be crucial to help finance the adoption of novel technologies, especially
              for early adopters. This type of financing could be especially helpful for younger, smaller firms that
              lack internal funds and a financial track record to turn to more traditional forms of financing
              (Hall & Lerner, 2010). Cross-country correlations across EU countries provide a mixed picture.
              Although we find a positive correlation between the depth of credit markets and the share of firm
              adoption for all but two technologies, the correlation between the availability of venture capital
              and technology adoption is positive for the most recent 4.0 technologies—cloud computing, big
              data analysis, and 3D printing. These results suggest that risky finance is important for the
              adoption of more novel technologies which are not yet widely adopted.

              New technologies can disrupt the market status quo and are often adopted by new firms, making
              certain regulatory constraints relevant to the adoption decisions. Regulatory barriers limiting the
              entry of new firms can reduce the adoption of new technologies, especially in highly dynamic
              sectors—such as IT-intensive sectors—where startups are the key drivers of the adoptions of
              advanced technologies. Similarly, regulations limiting competition or protecting certain firms can
              reduce the expected benefit of adoption by limiting the effective competitive advantage—market
              gains—that firms could derive from the adoption of new technologies. Cross-country evidence
              from the EU seems to partially support these arguments, showing that indicators on the ease
              of starting business are positively correlated with increases in adoption for CRM, ERP, cloud
              computing, and Internet of Things. More generally, because technology adoption requires the firms
              to invest, market distortions and misallocation reduce incentives to invest as they would reduce
              the expected returns (Iacovone et al., 2023).



20 By   making certain complementary skills more common, it can also reduce their price on the labor market.

2.4.2	         Technology adoption takes place among more productive firms,
               with skilled workers and good management
               The net returns of adopting a new technology can depend on certain enabling characteristics of
               potential adopters, making them an important factor in the adoption decision. This section uses
               firm-level data from Italy to describe some of these factors. The analysis focuses on firms that did
               not adopt a technology in 2014–16—as reported in the ICT 2017 survey—and looks at the factors
               that can predict their adoption of a new technology over the period 2017–18—as reported in the
               2019 census. In doing this, the analysis focuses on the characteristics of firms before the adoption
               of the new technologies. It then correlates these characteristics with the probability of adopting a
               technology between 2017 and 2018.21 This section focuses on the role of firms’ productivity and on
               the pre-adoption skill composition of their workforce as enablers of technology adoption.

 BOX 2.3. Self-declared obstacles to technology adoption
 The EUROSTAT ICT Enterprise survey asks respondents to identify the most important obstacles in technology
 adoption and the reasons for adopting some others. A summary of the responses is presented in Figure B2.3.1.

 The most often cited reason to not adopt AI is lack of human resources, followed by not seeing it as a priority and
 high costs (Figure B2.3.1, panel a). This underscores that the most recent informational technologies such as big
 data analysis have high adoption costs and may explain their low levels of adoption despite them potentially being a
 general-purpose technology (compare Acemoglu et al. 2022b).

 Robots tend to be adopted to ensure high precision, standardized quality, and safety at work, whereas reasons such
 as high labor costs are only of secondary importance (rank 4 out of 6) (Figure B2.3.1, panel b).

                The skill composition of a firm’s workforce is an important determinant of its adoption of new
                technologies (see also Box 2.3 Self-declared obstacles to technology adoption). Firms that use
                higher levels of nonroutine cognitive tasks are on average more likely to adopt a new technology—
                see Table 2.2.22 Similarly and related, having a higher share of workers holding a graduate diploma
                is a predictor of higher future adoption, but the evidence is noisier—see Table 2.2. These results
                reinforce the idea that the availability of complementary human capital to a technology is an
                important enabler of technology adoption.23 Having the right set of skills already embedded in its
                current workforce reduces the expected adoption cost, reducing the time-consuming and costly
                process of hiring new workers with complementary skills—and potentially training them to perform
                firm-specific processes—and limiting the risk of delays in using the newly adopted technology. A
                more skilled workforce might also be more conscious of the potential benefits of new technologies
                and is more likely to push toward adopting these technologies.

                Among firms not using an advanced technology, those that are more productive have a higher
                probability of adopting it. The data shows that the relationship between a firms’ productivity
                and its likelihood of adopting a new technology is positive and statistically significant for most
                technologies covered in the ICT survey (third column in Table 2.2). For example, a 1 percent increase
                in labor productivity increases the probability of adopting by about 0.23 percentage points. This
                result suggests that productivity is an enabler—or proxies for other enablers—of technological
                adoption. Other things equal, more productive firms are likely to be in a better position to reap
                the benefits of new technologies because they might already have several enabling factors that
                are complementary to new technologies or can maximize their benefits, such as better managerial
                practices, better access to larger markets, more widespread access to basic enabling technologies,
                and better links with productive suppliers. The effect is particularly strong for basic technologies,
                suggesting that highly productive firms are unlikely to forgo the low-hanging benefits of these
                technologies for a long period, indicating that more productive—and likely better-managed—firms
                are better at identifying opportunities to upgrade.



22 The     results in the table are based on the indexes of task content described in Box 1.2.
23 Of    course, firms can hire new workers with the right set of skills while or after adopting the new technology. However, when the labor market is
    frictional, and specific skills are scarce, having the right workforce already in place can reduce the expected costs of installing the new technology.

BOX 2.4. Limitation of current data landscape on technology adoption among firms in the EU and how a
recent World Bank initiative can help

This report identified limitations in the current data landscape on technology adoption and use of technologies by
firms in the EU. EUROSTAT Community Survey on ICT Usage and E-Commerce in Enterprises is the main source of
data on the state of technology adoption by firms in the EU. This survey has the advantage of being an EU-wide
standardized survey, allowing for a comparison of adoption levels across countries. It still has limitations that constrain
the analyses. The survey 1) focuses on the extensive margin of technology adoption—adopting or not adopting a
technology—but has limited information on the intensity of use of each technology; 2) the survey focuses on a limited
set of technologies, with a list of covered technologies that changes over time; 3) the survey is homogeneous across
sectors; 4) the survey has limited information on which tasks are carried out using any given technology.

The recently developed World Bank Technology Adoption Survey provides an example of how some gaps can be filled.
The survey collects information on the use of 305 technologies to carry out 63 business functions. Some of these
technologies and business functions are common across sectors—for example, ERP software used in HR processes—
whereas others are sector-specific—such as thermal processing technologies in food processing anti-bacterial
treatments. The survey collects information on both the most advanced and most used technology used by surveyed
firms to carry out each business function, thus collecting information on both the extensive and intensive margin of
technology use among firms. Overall, the information collected with the WB Technology Adoption Survey can support
a more granular analysis of technology adoption among firms.



         Good management practices such as performance
         monitoring, target setting, and people management foster
                                                                                        “Within the firm,

                                                                                        of the employees,
         greater productivity gains from adopting ICT than European
         firms. This is due to superior management practices. Various                   the level of labor
         studies conducted across European countries have shown                         productivity, and
         that low levels of technology adoption can be attributed                       management
         to inadequate managerial capabilities (Calvino et al., 2022;
         Cirillo et al., 2023). Skilled managers can help with the
                                                                                        practices determine

                                                                                        adopted and to what
         managed firms can realize higher returns from advanced
         digital technologies. An EU-wide survey of 12,800 firms                        extent the firm would

         are closely linked to the adoption of digital technologies.                    the adoption.”
         Firms that adopt digital technologies are more likely to set
         traditional management goals such as strategic business
         monitoring and performance pay, as well as score higher on
         monitoring gender balance and climate targets, indicating
         a potential virtuous cycle of management practices aiding
         technology adoption and digital technologies aiding progress
         monitoring across various business goals.


                                                                     CHAPTER 2 – PATTERNS OF TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION          29
           The education of managers is an important driver of good management practices and is positively
           related to take-up of new technologies (Caselli & Coleman, 2001; Comin & Hobijn, 2004). A study of
           Brazilian firms found that managers with at least a bachelor’s degree are four percentage points
           more likely to adopt advanced digital technologies in their companies (Cirera et al., 2021).
           To promote technology adoption, policies should be aimed at imparting both good management
           practices and digital skills to managers, especially for small firms. According to Calvino et al. (2022),
           small businesses in the EU often have CEOs and middle managers who lack the necessary skills and
           capabilities. Therefore, policies aimed at increasing technology adoption should not only focus on
           providing financing or incentives, but also address management practices (Berlingieri et al., 2020).
           This means that policies promoting digital skills and managerial capabilities should be implemented
           alongside technology adoption policies. Although improving managerial capabilities can be challenging,
           managerial coaching, advising, and mentoring have been shown to enhance firm performance.24


2.5	Summary
           This chapter analyzes technology adoption patterns based on firm-level data for Italy and
           sectoral data for the EU. The study focuses on various technologies, ranging from established
           ones like ERP and CRM to more novel ones like big data analysis and IoT. The findings reveal that
           a significant portion of firms adopt no digital technology, highlighting the potential for improving
           productivity through wider technology adoption. The adoption gap is larger among smaller
           enterprises, suggesting that policy makers should especially focus on this segment if they want to
           expand adoption in Europe. The chapter also finds that there are important differences in terms
           of adoption across different technologies. The firm-level adoption patterns follow a hierarchical
           structure. Easier-to-adopt technologies (that is, those requiring smaller initial investments) and
           more mature technologies like ERP and CRM being are more widespread. By comparison, more
           advanced technologies like robots and big data analysis are adopted primarily by larger and
           technologically sophisticated firms. There are also regional and sectoral differences in technology
           adoption, with Northern European countries and certain sectors leading such as ICT in adoption
           rates. The size and age of firms also play a role, with larger firms and younger ones having a greater
           propensity to adopt advanced technologies. In addition, the chapter discusses the obstacles and
           drivers of technology adoption, emphasizing the role of drivers internal to firms (emphasizing the
           role of complementary factors, such as firm managerial capabilities, workers’ skills and their share
           of nonroutine cognitive tasks) and external to the firms (such as access to finance and a suitable
           business environment). Finally, the chapter also suggests a potential risk of increased market
           concentration resulting from technology adoption by larger and more productive firms. Overall,
           the findings emphasize the need to address barriers to technology adoption and promote inclusive
           and widespread adoption of technology for enhanced productivity and competitiveness. They call
           for special attention to the barriers to adoption in lagging regions and among smaller businesses.

32   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
3.1	Introduction
             How incumbent firms and startups adopt and deploy the new technologies is key to determining
             how these technologies impact labor markets. As technologies become available, existing firms and
             startups must face the decision to adopt them, which depends on their expected returns and the
             costs of adoption, given their current know-how and absorptive capabilities (Verhoogen, 2023).
             Relying on detailed data25 across EU27+ we assess the patterns of technology adoption across
             countries and sectors, and different firms.26
             In this chapter, we present evidence on the impact of technology adoption and the patterns of
             adoption, relying both on EU-wide data and a case study on Italy. It is important to distinguish
             across different technologies because their characteristics, drivers of adoptions, and implications
             for labor markets can differ. In this chapter, we do not focus on technologies in a generic and
             homogeneous manner but distinguish among different technologies depending on their purpose
             and level of maturity.


3.2	         The impact of technology adoption in firms
             This section presents the results of an event study analysis on technology adoption in Italian firms.
             Adoption events are defined as the adoption of a technology by a firm not using it in earlier years.
             These events are identified by comparing data from the 2017 ICT survey (covering the 2014–16
             period) and the 2019 Firm Census (for the 2016–18 period) separately for six technologies.27 To limit
             concerns about the endogeneity of the technology adoption decision (for example, adopters being on
             a different growth path compared to non-adopters), the analysis relies on a synthetic difference-in-
             difference approach that follows the method presented in Arkhangelsky et al. (2021)—see Box 3.1.

 BOX 3.1. Synthetic difference-in-difference à la Arkhangelsky et al. (2021)
 The standard difference-in-difference approach would compare changes over time among firms that are treated with
 those among untreated firms. It then identifies the effect of a treatment—here technology adoption—as the change
 in the difference between treated and untreated firms, before and after the treatment. This approach relies on a key
 assumption: without the treatment, the outcome of interest among treated and untreated firms grows at the same
 rate. When this is not the case the estimated treatment effect would pick up differences in trends and would thus
 be uninformative about the actual effect of the treatment.

 The synthetic difference-in-difference approach used in this section mitigates some of the endogeneity concerns that
 can undermine standard difference-in-difference approaches. For each treated firm, the approach used in this section
 generates a synthetic control firm—generated as a combination of real untreated firms—for which the trend of the
 outcome variable in the pre-treatment period matches that of the treated firm. Under the assumption that this
 similarity in trends would have persisted absent the treatment, this method ensures that the difference-in-difference
 estimate captures the actual effect of the treatment. Although this method addresses some of the limitations of
 standard difference-in-difference approaches, some caveats still apply. In particular, any factor, independent of the
 treatment, affecting the treatment group (but not the control) in the post-treatment period violates the identification
 assumption underlying this method.28

25 The Eurostat Survey on ICT Usage and E-commerce in Enterprises provides information on actual adoption among firms across a broad range
 of technologies in a standardized, representative, and comparable manner for all EU27+ countries.
26 It should be noted that albeit these data are collected at firm-level we will rely on aggregated statistics at country, country-sector and

 country-firm size level as made available through Eurostat and not on the underlying micro-level firm data which are not publicly available.
27 Although the original dataset includes information on eight different technologies, the analysis in this chapter focuses on six technologies

 because we exclude two technologies: augmented reality and cybersecurity. Augmented reality is excluded because the very low rate of adoption
 for this technology does not provide enough variation to precisely identify its effect on adopters. Cybersecurity is excluded primarily because,
 as explained in Appendix A, after controlling for the simultaneous adoption of other technologies, its effect on adopters vanishes.
28 This would, for example, be the case if firms that adopt a technology do so in anticipation of a future event (such as an increase in future demand)

 that would have happened even without the adoption of the new technology and that differentially affects adopters relative to non-adopters.

                adoption event, and this effect is not homogeneous across technologies. The results suggest that the
                adoption of a new technology helps firms expand their activities by providing them with a competitive
                edge over their competitors.29 These results are in line with others found in the literature.30 How the
                adoption of a new technology can provide a competitive advantage to the adopter varies across
                technologies. Operational technologies that increase production efficiency—such as robots and 3D
                printing—allow adopters to reduce production costs, which can then be translated into lower prices,
                and an increase in the demand for products.31 Information technologies such as big data analytics
                can help the adopter improve its targeting of consumers, by more efficiently directing its marketing
                and adopting more targeted pricing strategies. Information technologies, such ERP and CRM, can
                increase the organizational efficiency of the adopter, reducing disruptions in its day-to-day business
                activities and improving the quality of its interactions with consumers.

                Although the adoption of all six ICT 2017 technologies is associated with an increase in the growth
                rate of adopters, the effect is larger for the adoption of robots, big data analytics, and IoT (Figure
                3.1, panel a). Not only these effects are statistically significant, but their magnitude is economically
                meaningful and large. For example, by 2019—4 years after adoption—firms adopting robots had a
                turnover close to 15 percent higher than non-adopters, whereas firms adopting big data analytics had
                a total turnover 16 percent higher (Figure 3.1, panel b). Sometimes multiple technologies are adopted
                at the same time, so when assessing the impact of each individual technology separately, we may
                be attributing to it effects that arise because this technology is adopted together with another one.
                Controlling for simultaneous adoption of multiple technologies does not change the overall picture but
                marginally reduces the effect of the adoption of each individual technology (see Appendix A).

34          THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
“The evidence                          The growth of firms adopting a new technology comes with an expansion of their

the argument                           firms experience faster employment growth than comparable firms (Figure 3.2,
                                       panel a).32 By 2019—4 years after adoption—firms adopting robots and big

technologies                           b). Thus, the argument that the adoption of new technologies causes a direct
                                       decrease in the overall labor demand in adopting firms does not seem supported
have direct                            by Italian data. This evidence refers to the direct effect of technology adoption
negative effect                        on adopting firms, not on the overall effect on aggregate labor demand—
on adopters’                           Section 3.3 discusses this point in more in detail. This finding is in line with
                                       evidence from existing literature, showing that technology adoption on average
labor demand”                          does not decrease the labor demand of adopting firms.33 Once again, the effect
                                       of the adoption of different technologies on labor demand is not homogeneous,
                                       with the adoption of robots, big data analytics, and Internet of Things having
                                       the strongest effect on employment growth whereas cloud computing is the
                                       technology with the lowest impact. The effect of technology adoption on firms’
                                       sales persistent during the Covid-19 pandemics, with the crisis widening the gap
                                       between adopters and non-adopters of operational technologies (Box 3.2).

               The positive effect of technology adoption on the labor demand of adopting firms is a direct
               consequence of expanding their activities. The data show that, except for ERP/CRM, the total value
               of sales in adopting firms increased more than proportional compared to the increase in employment
               (Figure 3.3, panel a). By 2019 and relative to non-adopting firms, in firms adopting big data analytics
               and robots, sales grew about 3.3 and 1.9 percentage points faster than employment, respectively
               (Figure 3.3, panel b). If adopters’ productivity—as measured by their sales per worker ratio—increased,
               it also suggests that, if their activity would not have grown, they would have reduced their labor
               demand, with a negative direct effect on employment (Figure 3.3). Section 3.3 discusses how this
               can play a role in the determination the effect of technology adoption on aggregate labor demand.
32 Comparable  firms are matched firms that were previously on a similar employment trend.

 adopting firms, Acemoglu et al. (2020), and Aghion et al. (2021) for evidence from France on the effect on total employment and adopters’
 labor share, Benmelech and Zator (2022) for evidence from Germany on the effect on employment, and Koch et al. (2021) for evidence on the
 effect on employment in Spanish firms.

“For workers’ wages                               For some technologies, there is evidence of a positive effect on the
                                                  average wages in adopting firms, but the magnitude of the effect is
at adopting firms,
                                                  small (Figure 3.4, panel a). The estimated impact on the average wages
the positive impact                               of adopting firms is positive for most technologies, but significant—

adoption is more                                  Things related technologies. However, much of the estimated effect
                                                  is driven by a jump in average wages among adopters during 2020.34
modest”                                           Part of the changes in the average wage paid by adopters might
                                                  reflect either some rent sharing or a change in the bargaining of
                                                  workers in adopting firms. However, at least part of this effect is
                                                  likely a compositional change in the workforce employed by adopting
                                                  firms. On the one hand, Section 3.2.2 shows evidence of an increase
                                                  in the level of skills demanded by adopting firms, a fact that could
                                                  explain part of the increase in wages. On the other, Appendix A shows
                                                  that, in relative terms, the workforce’s average age in adopting firms
                                                  dropped—a direct consequence of an increase in hirings—a fact that,
                                                  other things equal, would reduce the average wage paid by adopters.
                                                  No matter the cause, the change is relatively small. Between 2015 and
                                                  2019, the cumulative change in the average wage paid by adopters
                                                  ranged between an increase of about 1.1 percent—for adopters of
                                                  3D printing technologies—and a decrease of about 0.8 percent—for
                                                  adopters of ERP/CRM technologies (Figure 3.4, panel b).

 BOX 3.2. Technology and firms’ performance during the COVID crisis
 The effect of technology adoption on firms’ turnover and employment persisted during the pandemic, but the crisis
 magnified previous trends only for operational technologies. The data show that adopters continued to grow faster
 than non-adopters during the crisis, suggesting that the pandemic did not change the pre-trend (Figure B3.2.1,
 panels a and b). At the same time—under the assumption that pre-crisis growth differentials would have persisted in
 2020 at a pace like the one seen in 2019—there is no evidence of a differential impact of the pandemic on adopters
 of advanced information technologies, whereas there is evidence that adopters of operational technologies—and
 adopters of 3D printing in particular—coped better with the pandemic (Figure B3.2.1).35 This could be a direct
 consequence of the specific nature of the 2020 pandemic shock. Firms adopting automation technologies in their
 production process could perform a larger share of their production process without human presence, limiting the
 negative effect of social distancing measures on their activities.

35 Thedata show that in 2020 firms adopting big data and IoT saw a slowdown in their growth premia relative to non-adopters, suggesting that
 the pandemic might have impacted them more than non-adopters - relative to a counterfactual where they continued the growth differential
 remained equal to that observed in 2019. The opposite is true when considering employment growth.




                                                       CHAPTER 3 – TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION, CHANGE IN TASKS AND LABOR DEMAND                  37
 Differences in the average wage paid by adopters relative to non-adopters soared during the pandemic, but this
 is likely the result of lower use of part-time work among these firms. For all technologies, the growth rate of the
 adopters vs. non-adopters wage differential soared in 2020. In other words, the total wage bill paid by adopters
 relative to their total employment dropped less than among non-adopters. This is likely due to the widespread use of
 short-time work schemes to preserve employment among firms affected by the pandemic. As part of the wage bill in
 firms using these schemes is covered by the government, they reduce the total wage bill paid by the beneficiary firm.
 As non-adopters were more likely to see larger drop in sales in 2020, they were also likely to rely more intensively on
 short-time schemes, a fact that would explain the jump seen in 2020 in Figure 3.4, panel b.



3.2.2	      Firms adopting new technology demand workers with more education
            Among firms adopting advanced technologies, there is a shift away from routine manual tasks and
            toward nonroutine cognitive analytical ones with an associated increase in the average education
            of new hires, but the evidence remains noisy. As discussed in the previous chapter, extensive
            literature suggests that advanced technologies might complement some tasks while substituting
            others, thus changing the mix of tasks required to be completed to efficiently carry out a production
            process.36 Because carrying out different tasks requires different skills, this technology-induced
            change in the task content of production processes can change the skill-specific labor demanded.
            In some cases, if enough new tasks are created, a new occupation might emerge.

            Figure 3.5 shows the effect of technology adoption on the intensity
            of two types of tasks—nonroutine cognitive analytical (panel
            a) and routine manual (panel b)—in the jobs performed by newly
            hired workers. For the analysis in this chapter, nonroutine cognitive
            analytical and routine manual arguably represent the two extreme
            cases of task exposure to advanced technologies. (See Section 1.2.2
            for a discussion of the definition of task content of jobs.) Routine
            manual tasks are highly automatable and are thus at higher risk
            of being substituted by new technologies. Nonroutine cognitive
                                                                                                               “Technology
            analytical tasks are most likely to be complementary to the adoption
            of new technologies, as many of the highly analytical tasks needed                                 adoption
            to use advanced technologies fall into this category. The effect of                                changes the task
            adoption on the demand for nonroutine cognitive analytical tasks
            is positive for operational technologies and advanced information
                                                                                                               composition of
            technologies but only statistically significant for robots. The opposite                           jobs in adopting
            effect is seen for routine manual tasks, with negative—but once again                              firms, shifting it
            noisy—estimates of the impact of adoption on the demand for these
            tasks for all technologies, except ERP. The data thus support the                                  toward cognitive
            idea that technology adoption changes the task composition of jobs                                 analytical tasks
            in adopting firms, shifting it toward cognitive analytical tasks and
            away from manual tasks. Nonetheless, these effects are too noisy to
                                                                                                               and away from
            draw a firm conclusion and should thus be interpreted with caution.                                manual tasks.”

36 See for example Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Goos et al. (2014) for a discussion on the task-specific effect of technologies. Recent exam-
 ples of work on the task- or worker-specific effect of the adoption of new technologies include Acemoglu, Autor, et al. (2022), which provides
 empirical evidence specific to AI, and Acemoglu et al. (2023), which provides evidence of the specific effect of the adoption of robots on dif-
 ferent types of workers.

                 The shift in the mix of tasks was stronger in the first few years after the technology adoption,
                 indicating that firms adjusted their workforce early on and quickly settled on a new equilibrium.
                 Figure 3.6 shows the evolution of nonroutine cognitive and routine manual tasks performed by
                 newly hired in Italian firms adopting new technology—compared to the evolution among non-
                 adopting firms. Figure 3.6 captures the changes in task intensity following the technology adoption,
                 as it concentrates in new hired workers. The results show that the largest change in nonroutine
                 cognitive task intensity took place two years after the technology was adopted.37 Similarly, the index
                 capturing the intensity of routine manual tasks decreases by 22 percent two years after the event
                 of technology adoption. These results show that the adoption of robots had a sizable initial effect on
                 the composition of tasks performed in adopting firms. Most of this effect is concentrated in the first
                 two or three years after the adoption period, suggesting that firms adjusted their workforce early on
                 and while they were still adopting the new technologies by creating more jobs intensive in cognitive
                 analytical tasks and less intensive in routine manual tasks. As this initial change in the composition
                 of hirings was meant to adjust the equilibrium task mix of the jobs performed in the firm, estimates
                 on the task mix performed by new hires increase rapidly early in the adoption period. After this
                 initial adjustment, the composition of new hires among adopters reflected—through the normal
                 process of worker turnover—the new equilibrium task composition performed by their workforce. The
                 new equilibrium task mix among new hires among adopters was thus more cognitive-intensive than
                 before the adoption event but less so than during the initial adjustment period.

“Technology                      There is some evidence that changes in the task composition of jobs among
                                 adopters came with changes in the skill composition of their labor demand—
adoption                         leading to an increase in the average education level of their employees. Because
increases the                    higher education graduates have the skills to perform nonroutine cognitive tasks,
                                 the change in the task composition of jobs in firms adopting new technologies led
demand of                        to an increase in the demand for workers with higher educational levels. The data

                                 remain noisy. The share of workers with a graduate degree increased after the

40       THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
3.3	        Technology adoption, market concentration, and
            aggregate labor demand
            The aggregate effect of technology adoption on labor demand                                     “Technology
            depends on both its direct effect on adopters and its indirect
            (general equilibrium) effects on other firms.38 The results based in                            adoption affects
            Italian firms only capture the effect of technology adoption on                                 labor demand also
            the labor demand of adopting firms. However, the adoption of
                                                                                                            indirectly, through
            technologies by a group of firms also affects the other firms in

            effects of technology on non-adopting firms determine its impact                                market equilibrium”
            on aggregate labor demand through these channels:

            1	 Market-stealing effect: as adopters gain a competitive advantage over other firms, they grow
               faster than their competitors. The adoption of new technologies thus generates a market-
               stealing effect where adopters gain market shares at the expense of non-adopters. These
               market-stealing dynamics can hurt the labor demand of firms competing with adopters.

            2	 Market size effect: adopting new technologies in a subgroup of firms changes the equilibrium
               prices in the product market. Technologies help adopting firms reduce production costs and
               eventually offer final goods at a lower price. Technology adoption can expand the aggregate
               quantity demanded by reducing average prices in the economy. Other things equal, this market
               size effect increases the aggregate demand for labor.

            3	 Linked sectors effect: adopting new technologies in a particular sector also has consequences for
               industries that either provide or buy inputs from adopting firms. Downstream sectors can benefit
               from the lower inputs prices made possible by increased productivity among their suppliers.
               Reducing production costs can then be passed through their products’ prices, boosting labor
               demand. Technology adoption also generates new demand for upstream industries producing
               capital goods and inputs complementary to the latest technologies, potentially changing the
               mix of inputs demanded by adopters. These changes can trickle down to the demand for labor
               in linked sectors, contributing to the overall change in labor demand.39

     literature has found evidence of this cross-sector spillover effect. Mann and Püttmann (2021) and Dauth et al. (2021) find positive employ-
 ment effects of automation technologies—and robots in particular—adopted in manufacturing on the employment in linked services industries.



                                                     CHAPTER 3 – TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION, CHANGE IN TASKS AND LABOR DEMAND                       41
                 competition. But when firms face lower competitive pressure, they tend to absorb the decrease
                 in production costs without decreasing prices. In these environments cost-saving technologies
                 thus generate higher markups in adopting firms, with a muted effect on product prices. The
                 larger the market power of adopting firms, the lower the market size effect induced by their adoption
                 of cost-saving technologies.

            2	 Labor-saving technology: the second factor relates to the nature of the newly adopted technology
               and how the technology changes the production process in an adopting firm. The higher the
               labor-saving intensity of the technology, the lower the transmission of changes in output to labor
               demand—with a correlation between changes in output and changes in employment that can
               turn negative for high labor-saving technologies.

            3	 Elasticity of labor supply: labor market conditions, specifically how responsive the labor supply is to
               changes in firms’ demand, determine technology effects on aggregate employment. Other things
               equal, the tighter the labor market, the stronger the transmission from aggregate product demand to
               wages and the weaker its transmission to employment.40 Thus, in a tighter labor market—a situation
               where many firms compete for few workers—a technology-induced increase in labor demand will
               generate a higher increase in wages and a lower increase in employment.

            Estimates of the direct effect of technology adoption among Italian firms show that adopters
            grow faster than their competitors (Figure 3.1), thus gaining market share. The evidence also
            shows that adopters tend to have higher initial levels of sales per workers (Figure 3.3, panel a)
            than non-adopters and that this difference increases after an adoption event (Figure 3.3, panel
            b). These two pieces of evidence show that holding the size of the market fixed, the combination
            of the direct effect of technology adoption on adopters and of the indirect market-stealing
            effect it induces have a clear negative impact on labor demand. The sign of the overall effect
            of technology adoption on aggregate labor demand thus depends on the magnitude of the
            market size effect that the adoption of new technology can induce through its effect on prices.
            Aggregate labor demand increases only when the efficiency gains from technology adoption
            generate an increase in output that is large enough to more than compensate for its labor-
            saving and market-stealing effects.

            Using data on the US and several European countries, existing literature shows that although
            the direct effect of technology on employment in adopting firms is usually positive, the overall
            effect on aggregate employment is mixed.41 Box 3.3, for example, provides sector-level evidence
            based on EU-wide data, showing a weak, mostly negative correlation between adoption rates and
            sectoral employment growth. Ensuring that higher technology adoption does not translate into an
            excessive market power among adopting firms and that it instead translates into lower prices for
            consumers is thus crucial to ensure a more equitable technology adoption process.

40 A tight labor market is a situation where the demand for labor is large, but the supply is limited—firms post many vacancies but relatively
  few workers are looking for a job.
41 Acemoglu et al. (2020) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) find a strong overall negative effect of robot adoption on employment in the

  US and France. Using data from the US and several European countries, Graetz and Micheals (2018) and Benmelech and Zator (2022) find
  negative direct effects of robot adoption on employment in adopting firms, but only a weak overall negative effect on employment. Mann
  and Püttmann (2021) and Dauth et al. (2021) show that while the adoption of robot led to a decline in manufacturing employment, this was
  compensated by an increase in services employment, leading to only minor aggregate employment changes. Aghion et al. (2021) show evidence
  that the adoption of robots in French manufacturing firms led to an overall increase in industry employment.

                              in adopting and non-adopting firms is a key driver of the overall effect of technology

                              of firms. Indirect effects can be large and should be considered when assessing the
                              overall effects of technology on the labor market.



 BOX 3.3. Sectoral cross-country patterns in the EU
 We use sectoral data from several EU countries to complement the firm-level evidence from Italy presented so far.
 We rely on aggregate data from the EUROSTAT Survey on ICT Usage and E-commerce in Enterprises and additional
 EUROSTAT data. Although this analysis has the advantage of being based on a broader set of countries, compared to
 the firm-level analysis based on Italian data, it provides mostly descriptive evidence because it presents correlations
 absent a robust identification strategy. Appendix A explains the specification used for the analysis.

 Increases in sectoral productivity translate into a reduction in sectoral employment due to a weak
 relationship between technology adoption and market expansion. As pointed out in Section 3.3.1, because
 of the effects of technology adoption on labor productivity, technology’s impact on labor demand depends
 on its market size effect. EU-wide data show that, for most technologies, a higher adoption rate in a
 sector is associated with either no change or a limited increase in sectoral value added (Figure B3.3.2,
 panel b). Due to this limited market size effect, the higher labor productivity associated with a higher
 adoption rate translates into a reduction in sectoral employment (Figure B3.3.2, panel a)—albeit, except
 for 3D printing, the coefficients are not statistically significant at the conventional significance level.
 Overall, EU cross-country data suggest that on average technology adoption is not associated with a
 market size effect that is strong enough to offset its negative effect on labor demand.

44      THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
3.4	Summary
    The evidence in this chapter indicates that implementing advanced technologies has a significant
    impact on the performance of adopting firms. Following the adoption, these firms experience
    faster growth in sales, employment, and productivity compared to non-adopters. This suggests
    that technology plays a crucial role in determining a firm’s success and provides adopters with a
    competitive edge. However, there are also some concerns to consider. The adoption of technology
    is more common among large firms, which can lead to an increase in market concentration and
    the concentration of market power among a few adopters. Additionally, there is evidence of
    technology-induced skill substitution, with workers holding a university degree experiencing a rise
    in labor demand. This could widen the wage gap between university graduates and other workers.

    The effects of technology on aggregate labor demand largely depend on how productivity gains
    among adopting firms are transmitted into aggregate output. Although the evidence in this
    section focuses primarily on the direct effects of adoption on adopting firms, the aggregate
    implications of technology adoption on the economy depend on how its direct effects transmit to
    the market equilibrium. The evidence suggests that the aggregate effect of technology adoption
    on the aggregate labor demand will largely depend on how firms and markets pass the gains of
    technological adoption to consumers. Minimizing the potentially harmful effect of technological
    adoption on workers—and maximizing its gains for the economy—requires making sure technological
    productivity gains are passed through to prices and wages. A strategy to mitigate the risks that
    technology increases market concentration and constraints the benefit for workers is to promote
    technology adoption among small and micro firms.

46   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
4.1	Introduction
               This chapter analyzes the adequacy of skills provision systems in Europe to face the challenges
               introduced by technological progress. Our analysis focuses on the role played by formal education
               systems, particularly upper-secondary VET, in shaping the effects of technology on the labor
               market and income distribution. Half of the students in upper secondary in the EU are enrolled in
               VET, and these students tend to come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Hence, we emphasize
               this critical component of the skills provision system for promoting productivity and inclusion
               in the EU.

               As the results in earlier chapters show, when firms adopt new technologies, the tasks perform
               within those firms become more cognitive, analytical, and social and less routine and manual.
               Workers with specific skills—proxied by their education level or degree—are more able to perform
               these tasks. For example, according to the results from the Italian firm-level analysis, university
               graduates have the right skills to perform cognitive, analytical, and social tasks, all of which
               complement technological progress. Are VET graduates getting the skills that let them perform
               cognitive, analytical, and social tasks to benefit, in the form of higher wages or employment, from
               technological progress?

               The focus of this chapter is on upper-secondary VET. Postsecondary VET is an important
               component of the skill provision system of EU countries. However, its reach is more limited in terms
               of the population covered, and the resources spent on it are small compared to the investment
               that countries do in upper-secondary VET. As such, we focus our attention on the part of the VET
               system that has the largest coverage and accounts for most of the budget. Thus, in this chapter,
               when we refer to “VET students” and “VET graduates,” we refer to upper-secondary VET students
               and graduates, respectively. “VET graduates” should be understood as upper-secondary graduates
               from VET institutions that did not pursue further studies, either in postsecondary or tertiary
               institutions. “Foundational skills” refers to cognitive skills, such as literacy and numeracy, and non-
               cognitive skills, such as socioemotional skills, which include social skills.

               This chapter uses data from all editions of PISA, PIAAC, and the EU Labor Force Survey covering
               2004-19 to measure cognitive skills, tasks performed at work, and labor market outcomes of
               VET and non-VET graduates, respectively.42 We complement the EU-wide analysis of skills, tasks,
               and labor market outcomes of VET and non-VET graduates with the firm-level analysis for Italy,
               letting us identify the role of VET graduates in firms adopting new technologies.

               The empirical analysis of labor market outcomes in this chapter is correlational because the cross-
               country set up does not allow for a causal analysis that identifies the effects of vocational training
               separately from those of other confounding factors. However, to the degree that is possible, the
               analysis will allow controlling for some of these factors—such as the different nature of VET
               systems across countries, socioeconomic conditions, the gap in literacy and numeracy, and age,
               time period, and birth cohort effects. The analysis sheds light on the difference in labor market
               outcomes between VET and non-VET graduates when these factors are accounted for.

4.2	           VET systems in the EU
               The educational system of the countries in the EU is characterized by a strong presence of VET
               institutions. The participation of people 15–24 years old in VET in EU countries is relatively high
               compared to the rest of the world (Figure 4.1, panel a). In the average EU country, about 18
               percent of the young aged 15 to 24 are enrolled in some technical vocational education or training,
               compared to 8 percent in high-income non-EU countries and 5 percent in the remaining countries.

               A similar pattern is seen when focusing on students enrolled in upper-secondary education (Figure
               4.1, panel b). Within this group of students, the share enrolled in VET tracks is 48 percent in the
               average EU country, representing over 8.7 million students of the 17.9 million students enrolled in
               upper secondary in EU countries during 2020. In high-income non-EU countries, the share of upper-
               secondary students enrolled in VET tracks was 19 percent, whereas in the remaining countries, the
               share was 21 percent. Within the EU, the highest percentages of enrollment in VET among upper-
               secondary students are in Slovenia (70.8 percent), the Czech Republic (70.5 percent), Croatia (69.3
               percent), and Austria (68.7 percent), whereas the lowest shares are found in Cyprus (16.8 percent),
               Ireland (24.1 percent), Lithuania (24.7 percent), and Malta (27.6 percent).

               The centrality of vocational education in the European educational landscape is not an effect
               (nor a cause) of its relatively high income levels. High-income countries in other regions of the
               world have lower enrollment rates in VET compared to EU countries. The importance of VET in
               Europe stems from the region’s history: formal VET institutions emerged with the development of
               manufacturing industries, and its characteristics—whether more intensive in classroom learning or
               in apprenticeship schemes—were shaped by each country’s industrialization process.43

48         THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
4.2.1	      VET students come from a relatively disadvantaged socioeconomic background
            The role of VET in skills development is important for the entire labor force in the EU but particularly
            for those with a vulnerable background. Data from the 2018 PISA round indicates that the average
            value of the index of economic, social and cultural status—a measure capturing differences in students’
            social backgrounds—for upper-secondary students enrolled in the vocational track is significantly
            lower than among general track students across the EU (Figure 4.2, panel a). This difference exceeds
            half a standard deviation in nine of the 12 EU countries with information, and it is over 80 percent
            of the standard deviation in Hungary and Slovenia. Educational background of students’ parents is
            significantly different among VET and non-VET students: 34 percent of vocational students have
            a mother with tertiary education, and 30 percent have a father with tertiary education, whereas
            among general track students, these values are 50 percent and 49 percent respectively.

Note: Panel a of this graph plots the distribution of the index of economic, social and cultural status among upper-secondary
students in EU countries sampled in the 2018 round of the PISA survey. The blue line plots the distribution of the index for upper-
secondary students in the general track. The maroon line plots the distribution of the index for upper-secondary students in the
vocational track. Panel b plots the evolution of the index of economic, social and cultural status among upper-secondary students in
EU countries sampled in the 2006, 2012 and 2018 round of the PISA survey. Only countries with a meaningful sample of vocational
track students are included (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal,
Romania, and Slovenia). The index has a value of zero, which corresponds to the average of each survey respondent’s country.


            This difference between the sociocultural profile of vocational track students and general track
            students has been increasing. Figure 4.2, panel b presents the evolution of the average index of
            economic, social, and cultural status for the students of the two tracks in the 2006, 2012, and
            2018 rounds of PISA. The index’s difference increased by 54 percent when comparing the values
            of the 2006 round to those of the 2018 rounds. In this, the social background of the average VET
            student is increasingly more disadvantaged than that of the average student in the general track.

            There are different reasons why upper-secondary VET students tend to come from a more
            disadvantaged socioeconomic background. On the one hand, this is a family choice. Parra-Cely
            (2023) uses data from the Netherlands and estimates the value parents attach to their children’s
            secondary school tracks by measuring their willingness to travel to school. His estimates show
            that, for equally proficient children, highly educated parents will let their offspring commute longer
            distances to attend tracks that grant direct admission to a university, whereas parents from lower
            socioeconomic status prefer their children to have shorter commutes to school even if this limits

            their possibilities to go to university by enrolling into vocational tracks. The author estimates that
            about half of the enrollment gap between pupils with low and highly educated parents can be
            attributed to the heterogeneity of family preferences alone.

            Educational practices also influence the selection of students into each track. Carlana et al.
            (2023) find that, in Italy, teachers at the end of lower secondary recommend students from lower
            socioeconomic status to follow vocational tracks even if they are as proficient as students from
            higher socioeconomic status, who are recommended to follow general tracks leading to tertiary
            education. For example, 54 percent of students in the top decile of math scores are recommended
            to the top academic tracks if their mother has less than high school education, and 81 percent
            are given the same recommendation if their mother has college education. This bias in track
            recommendations may result from implicit stereotypes held by teachers, which also affects
            immigrant children in school (Carlana et al., 2022).

4.2.2	   VET students have lower cognitive skills
                                       Despite the large heterogeneity of VET systems across EU member
“In PISA 2018, the                     states, the academic outcomes of their students tend to follow

vocational track students              science are significantly lower for upper-secondary students in the
                                       vocational track than for students in the general track (see Figure
below the minimum level                4.3, panel a for the case of math scores; a similar pattern is present
of skill proficiency in                for reading and science scores). The average share of vocational

                                       shares were 45 percent and 18 percent respectively, and in science
was 17 percent.”                       they were 48 percent and 21 percent respectively.

50       THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
             Although in all countries vocational track students underperform with respect to general track
             students, the magnitude of this difference is heterogeneous. Figure 4.3, panel b presents the
             difference in average scores in math between vocational and general track students in EU countries
             in the 2018 round of PISA (similar values are found for the case of reading and science). Luxembourg
             and the Czech Republic are the countries where this difference has the lowest magnitude. The
             largest differential in math is seen in Slovenia, where vocational track students have an average
             score 113 points lower than that of general track students—a difference equivalent to around a
             whopping four years of schooling.44 Large differences, exceeding the equivalent of three years of
             schooling, are seen in Belgium, Croatia, Greece, and Romania.

             There is a significant underperformance of VET students, and the gap between VET and non-
             VET students has been increasing. In 2006, the underperformance of vocational track students
             compared to general track students was 43 points in math, 52 points in reading, and 43 points
             in science. By 2018, these values had increased to almost 61 points in math, almost 75 points in
             reading, and 67 points in science.

             Although underperformance of VET students is common across countries, general track students
             also have a relatively low performance in cognitive skills in some EU countries. In Bulgaria, Greece,
             and Romania, more than a quarter of general track students are below level 2 of proficiency in
             math, reading, and science according to the results of PISA 2018. In the Czech Republic and
             Luxembourg over 20 percent of general track students are also below that level.

4.2.3	       VET systems across the EU are heterogeneous
             VET systems in upper secondary can be characterized along different dimensions, showing great
             heterogeneity and high diversity between EU countries.45 The first dimension is the nature of
             entry into the system. Students can enter a vocational program by means of a voluntary and
             unrestricted choice, after passing a voluntary but selective exam or by “tracking” (that is, by being
             recommended or selected into the vocation track following strict criteria). The age of entry can
             also be different, with some systems (for example, the Netherlands and Lithuania) having an early
             entry at the lower secondary level and others (for example, Norway, Poland, and Romania) in the
             later years of upper secondary. Integration with parallel, non-vocational tracks is another relevant
             dimension: in some systems (for example, Croatia, Greece, and France), students can easily switch
             between the general and the vocational track of upper secondary, whereas in others (for example,
             Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden), they cannot, or if they can, they need to fulfill some
             curricular requirement (for example, Slovenia).

             The nature of learning within the VET system can also be very different. In some systems (for
             example, Croatia, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic), learning is primarily academic and classroom-
             based. In others (for example, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), it mostly happens in a workplace
             setting, with apprenticeships being the most straightforward example. The duration of vocation
             programs is also different, with some lasting for several years (for example, five years in Hungary
             and four years in Malta, Slovenia, Netherlands, and Sweden) whereas others (for example, Cyprus
             and the Czech Republic) are only one or two years.

44 Following Woessmann (2016) “[a]s a rule of thumb, learning gains on most national and international tests during one year are equal to
 between one-quarter and one-third of a standard deviation, which is 25–30 points on the PISA scale.” In the case of Slovenia, 113 points of
 difference would be equivalent to between 4.52 and 3.77 years of schooling.
45 Routes with various entry characteristics, minimum age, duration, and possibility of access to higher education, among others, coexist within

 different countries of the EU. The examples provided here are incomplete and are meant to show some heterogeneity across countries.




                                               CHAPTER 4 – VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN CHANGING LABOR MARKETS                       51
             The diploma obtained when finishing a vocational program may differ across systems. In some
             (for example, Croatia, Finland, and Greece), these diplomas allow for a continuation into tertiary
             education, whereas in others (for example, Germany, Norway, and Poland), they do not. In some
             systems (for example, Croatia, Estonia, Germany, and Greece), vocational diplomas serve as
             professional certificates that let individuals work in certain occupations, whereas in others (for
             example, Hungary and France), they are simply certificates of completion.

             From an institutional perspective, the degree of involvement of social partners—namely, business
             chambers, trade unions, and nongovernment organizations—may also differ across systems.
             In some (for example, Croatia and Denmark), social partners actively participate in the design
             of curricula. In others, (for example, Greece), they actively participate in the design of learning
             activities and the recognition of certificates. In still other systems (for example, Spain), this
             participation is more limited.

             VET systems across Europe differ across all these dimensions. Table 4.1 presents the classification
             of EU countries’ systems in just two: the age of entry into the system and the share of work-based
             learning. As the table shows, there is no clustering of countries in a specific combination of these
             two dimensions. Rather, countries differ simultaneously along them. In this sense, VET systems are
             heterogeneous across the EU and far from following a similar, homogeneous model.

4.3	        Labor market outcomes among VET graduates
            In many EU countries, the cost of producing a VET graduate is much higher than that of a graduate
            from the general secondary track. This higher cost is justified by the labor market advantage VET
            systems should generate for its graduates. By emphasizing professional competencies, VET systems
            should provide students with low academic achievements and relatively disadvantaged backgrounds
            with better employment and earning prospects. In this section, we exploit data from PIAAC and
            the EU Labor Force Survey to compare the earnings and employment profile of VET graduates
            with graduates from the secondary education track without tertiary education. In this sense, our
            most important counterfactual comparator for upper-secondary VET graduates that did not obtain
            tertiary education are upper-secondary graduates that followed a general track but did not pursue
            further education. An alternative comparator, usually discussed in the policy arena, could be lower
            secondary graduates or upper-secondary dropouts. This comparator assumes that the most valid
            counterfactual situation for an upper-secondary VET student is dropping out of education. Evidence
            from the academic literature disputes the validity of this counterfactual47 and we will compare the
            outcomes of VET graduates primarily with those of general secondary graduates.

47 Matthewes  and Ventura (2022) look at 16-years-old students in England who, based on the distance to the nearest school, are on the margin
 between attending upper secondary VET and attending general track upper secondary, and between attending upper secondary VET and
 dropping out. They find that 85 percent of the marginal students are on the margin between attending upper secondary VET and attending
 general track upper secondary, and only 15 percent of the marginal students are on the margin between upper secondary VET and dropping
 out of education. Birkelund and van de Werfhorst (2022) perform a similar analysis in Denmark and, while they do not estimate the share of
 marginal students in each margin, they point out that, in the younger cohorts which finished lower secondary in 2003-14, the share of drop-
 outs was below 8 percent and was mostly explained by individuals with physical and mental health disabilities as well as individuals in secure
 institutions and prisons.




                                                                                    CHAPTER 4 – VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN CHANGING LABOR MARKETS   53
            The results in this section should be interpreted cautiously since we do not have a valid identification
            strategy to isolate VET’s impact on labor market outcomes. The differences in hourly earnings or
            employment levels between VET and students that went to the general secondary education track
            (and did not go to university) presented below could be the outcome of a selection process rather
            than the result of the difference between the two tracks. So far, based on the PISA test, we have
            documented that VET students tend to be poorer and have lower cognitive skills than those who
            went to the general secondary track. However, students in the general secondary track at age 15—
            when the PISA test is applied—include those who will go to university and those who will not. The
            group to which we compare VET graduates’ labor market outcomes is the general secondary school
            graduates who did not attend university. This comparison group has, in almost every country, the
            same years of formal schooling as VET graduates.48 In our analysis of employment levels we rely
            on an age-period-cohort decomposition that allows controlling for factors that differ by age, period
            of analysis, and birth cohort. Factors that vary within these dimensions are not controlled for, so
            the results should be interpreted accordingly.

4.3.1	      VET graduates have lower earnings along the life cycle
                                       The earnings of different education groups are best studied with PIAAC,
“A vocational track                    an adult skills assessment that, apart from including labor earnings
graduate earns                         information, allows controlling for individual characteristics such as literacy
per hour worked                        and numeracy of respondents. An analysis using PIAAC data for a sample
                                       of 14 EU countries49 shows that the hourly earnings of VET graduates are,
about 3.5 percent                      on average, 3.5 percent lower than that of general secondary education
less than a general                    graduates that did not pursue higher education (labeled as “general track
graduate of the                        graduate” onwards) when conditioning on a set of individual characteristics
                                       like age, gender, location, parental education, numeracy, and literacy. That
same age, gender,
                                       is, a vocational track graduate earns per hour about 3.5 percent less than a
location, parental                     general track graduate of the same age, gender, location, parental education,
education,                             numeracy, and literacy. The negative association of vocational studies to
numeracy, and                          labor market earnings is large in some countries (over 9 percent in Belgium
                                       and exceeding 12 percent in Spain and the Slovak Republic) but also not
literacy.”                             significant in others (such as Finland, Italy, and Norway).

                                       Another relevant aspect of the earnings profile of VET graduates is their
                                       relatively low returns to experience. On average, VET graduates see their labor
                                       earnings increase about 0.5 percent for every year of experience, whereas
                                       general track graduates see an increase twice as large—about 1.2 percent for
                                       every year of experience. There is an initial advantage of VET graduates in
                                       labor market earnings but—given their flatter age-earning profile—this quickly
                                       reverts over time (Figure 4.5).




48 Depending on each country’s educational system, VET graduates may have at most a difference of one year of schooling (either one more
 year or one less year) with respect to general secondary graduates who did not attend university.

Note: this figure plots the predicted log hourly earnings (centered at the country mean) at different ages of general secondary
graduates (blue line) and VET graduates (maroon line). The values are derived from a linear regression of log hourly earnings, which
includes an interaction factor between age and educational track and country, gender, parental education, numeracy, and literacy
as control variables. The sample is restricted to individuals from 25 to 59 years old whose highest educational attainment is upper
secondary (ISCED 3) or postsecondary nontertiary education (ISCED 4).


            An interesting complement to this analysis is the findings of Cnossen et al. (2022), who look at
            the implications for labor market earnings of the skill content of VET degrees in the Netherlands.
            The authors find that graduates from VET degrees with a higher content of technical, specialized
            skills see lower earnings than graduates with a higher content of resource-management skills (like
            financial administration, project management, product storing) and basic, cognitive skills. On the
            one hand, a 10 percent increase in the degree’s curriculum allocated to technical, specialized skills
            (vis-à-vis the share allocated to basic skills) is associated with a 0.7 percent decrease in earnings.
            On the other hand, a 10 percent increase in the share of the degree’s curriculum allocated to
            resource-management skills (vis-à-vis the share allocated to basic skills) is associated with a 3.2
            percent increase in earnings. Graduates from VET degrees with a high content of social skills tend
            to sort into sectors of the economy that reward these skills, so their earnings are higher than
            those of VET graduates from degrees with a low content of social skills. However, conditional on
            the sector of employment, the earnings associated to a degree with a higher content of social skills
            are slightly lower than those associated to a degree with higher content of basic, cognitive skills.
            A similar analysis by Langer and Wiederhold (2023) on the skills taught in dual apprenticeships
            in Germany shows there are almost no significant returns to manual and administrative skills,
            whereas cognitive, digital, and social skills taught in vocational training show significant returns.

4.3.2	        VET graduates enjoy employment advantages, but these disappear a few years after entering the
              labor market
              According to EUROSTAT data, young VET graduates tend to have significantly higher employment
              rates than young graduates of general education in most EU countries. On average, the employment
              rate of VET graduates aged 20–34 was 76.1 percent in 2020, compared to just 58.3 percent for
              general education graduates of the same age. However, this snapshot may not represent the
              actual patterns of employment seen along the life cycle by vocational and general track graduates.

                                         old (Figure 4.6). VET graduates transition more quickly into work after
educational                              graduation than general education graduates (Vandeweyer and Verhagen,
groups for the age                       2020). This advantage quickly disappears, and the rates of VET graduates

                                         above those of general education graduates until around age 35.


 BOX 4.1. The age-period-cohort decomposition
 One of the main challenges in analyzing trends in economic choices and characteristics over the life cycle is to
 separately identify the variation caused by age, the variation associated with the time periods that affect all age
 groups, and cohort-level variation. A common approach to this challenge is the age-period-cohort (APC) decomposition,
 which estimates the life cycle profile of a variable (for example, job tenure in our case), the effects of shocks common
 to all individuals and specific to a period, and the effects specific to each cohort. A cohort is defined as a group of
 individuals entering a system simultaneously (for example, the year they were born or the year they enter the labor
 market); a period is defined as when the outcome is measured (for example, survey year); and age is the time since
 the system entry (for example, the time since a person was a born or entered the labor market).

 We model the employment outcome Eiapc of individual i as a linear function of the individual’s age (ai), period (pi), and
 cohort (ci ) effects. We define Eapc(the average employment outcome who were age a in survey year p and cohort c)
 such that                          , where n apc is the number of individuals in the corresponding APC cell. We also
 define vectors of age, period, and cohort dummies:                                                                                     and
                                       where K is the number of age categories, L is the number of survey rounds, M is the
 number of generational cohorts, and            is an indicator function.

 Then,                                                          , (1) where denotes the error term. To estimate model
 (1) using the APC method, we construct a panel of individuals by their APC identifiers. The EU-LFS collects age
 information in five-year intervals, and we combine survey years and cohorts to correspond to these five-year intervals
 to preserve the APC relationship. Thus, we have nine age intervals (from 20–24 years old to 60–64 years old), three
 survey-year intervals (2004–09, 2009–14, 2014–19), and 12 birth cohorts (from 1940–45 to 1995–99).

 The linear relation between age, period, and cohort requires us to impose two constraints on the model parameters to
 achieve identification. A popular approach introduced by Deaton and Paxson (1994) requires that the period effects be
 orthogonal to the age and cohort effects, implicitly assuming that structural trends in the period effects are absorbed
 by the age and cohort effects. This approach has been criticized for its arbitrariness. The maximum entropy (ME)
 estimator generates a distribution of estimates that satisfies the linear constraints of the standard APC models and
 produces estimates of the expected values of parameters corresponding to the ME probability distribution (Browning
 et al., 2012). We thus use the ME method for our estimation.

Note: this figure plots the age profile of the employment rate for various educational groups. The profile is derived from an age-
period-cohort decomposition of the employment rate of individuals in each educational group over the period 2004–19 in 17 EU/EEA
countries. To ease the interpretation of the graph, the values presented correspond to the predicted age profile of the employment
rate for the cohort of individuals born in 1970–74.


           The analysis of the cohort profile of the employment rate (Figure 4.7) shows that the youngest
           cohort of VET graduates seem to have closed (and even reversed) the gap with general secondary
           graduates that is present for older cohorts, and have also narrowed significantly the gap with
           tertiary graduates—although in the latter case the narrowing of the difference seems to be also
           due to a decrease in the employment rate of younger cohorts of tertiary graduates vis-à-vis
           older cohorts.

Note: this figure plots the cohort profile of the employment rate for various educational groups. The profile is derived from an age-
period-cohort decomposition of the employment rate of individuals in each educational group over the period 2004–19 in 17 EU/EEA
countries. To ease the interpretation of the graph, the values presented correspond to the predicted cohort profile of the employment
rate at age 40–44.


              The characteristics of VET systems across countries are not associated with different patterns
              of employment across educational groups. VET graduates’ initial advantage in the employment
              rate at the beginning of professional life disappears similarly across VET systems. Figure 4.8
              plots the difference in the employment rate between VET and tertiary graduates (panel a) and
              between VET and general secondary graduates (panel b) for countries grouped by the share of
              work-based learning in their VET systems—Figure 4.8 is basically the same graph as Figure 4.6 for
              VET graduates but expressing the employment rate as a difference with respect to that of tertiary
              graduates and that of general secondary graduates, respectively. Although point estimates may
              suggest that differences are smaller for countries where VET systems have a high share of Work-
              Based Learning (WBL), the confidence intervals overlap with those of the other country groups.51
              A similar pattern is seen when we group countries based on the age of entry to the VET system.
              The differences in employment profiles for VET and other graduates are not statistically different
              across countries with different ages of entry into the VET system.



51 Cahuc and Hervelin (2022) study the effect of workplace versus school-based vocational education on youth employment in France. They find
 a positive impact of increased workplace education on youth employment, although they caution that this impact is almost entirely explained
 from retention in the training firm without having a significant impact on employment in later stages of the professional life. A similar pattern
 is found in the study by Neyt et al. (2020) on the dual apprenticeship programs in Flanders (Belgium), which identifies a short term labor
 market advantage (that fades out quickly) for the program with the most days of on-the-job training. These findings could explain why in
 Figure 4.8, despite the point estimates suggesting a larger employment advantage of VET graduates in high WBL countries, the difference is
 not statistically significant, particularly in late stages of the professional life.

Note: this figure plots the age profile of the difference in employment rate between VET and tertiary graduates (panel a) and VET
and general secondary graduates (panel b). Three profiles are plotted in each panel, one for each country group based on the share
of WBL in VET (low, mid, and high—see Table 4.1). Each profile is derived from an APC decomposition of the employment rate of
individuals in each educational group over the period 2004–19 in the corresponding country group. To ease the interpretation of
the graph, the values presented correspond to the predicted difference in the age profile of the employment rate for the cohort of
individuals born in 1970–74.


            As we will discuss in the next section, the lack of labor market advantage among VET graduates—
            compared to labor market outcomes of general secondary education graduates—could be related
            to the tasks they are performing, the relationship between these tasks and technological progress,
            and the type of firms hiring them (see Box 4.2 for more details).




 BOX 4.2. Which firms hire VET graduates? Insights from Italy

 Although labor force surveys usually provide detailed information on the characteristics of the workforce, they are less
 informative about the characteristics of employers. The matched employer-employee database provided by ISTAT,
 the Italian statistical institute, provides a better picture of the characteristics of firms that hire VET graduates.
 A snapshot from 2018, the last pre-COVID year with full data on hires, shows that, on average, VET graduates
 represented 6.8 percent of total hires. This share, which can be interpreted as a “VET hiring intensity” varies across
 firms. A summary of the simple correlations between firm characteristics and VET hiring intensity are graphically
 presented in Figure B4.2.1.

 Note: this graph plots the simple correlation coefficients between firm characteristics and the share of VET graduates among
 hires in 2018. For the case of firm size and firm age, the coefficients correspond to the result of a simple regression with the
 different size and age categories as dummy independent variables. The reference category for firm size is between 0 and 25
 employees, and the reference category for firm age is between 0 and 5 years. The index of technology adoption corresponds to
 the number of technologies adopted by the firm out of the following eight: ERP, cloud computing, internet of things, augmented
 reality, big data, robots, 3D printing, and cybersecurity.


 Firms that are older, smaller, and less productive than the average tend to hire more VET graduates. For example, a
 firm that is older than 15 years hires 2.4 percentage points more VET graduates than a firm that is less than five
 years old, a difference that represents about 35 percent of the average VET hiring intensity. Similarly, a firm that
 is larger than 250 employees hires 2 percentage points fewer VET graduates than a firm that is smaller than 25
 employees, a difference that represents about 30 of the average VET hiring intensity. In terms of productivity, one
 indicator (revenue per worker) is associated negatively with VET hiring intensity, whereas another indicator (value
 added per worker) has a correlation that is not statistically different from zero. Last, a simple index of technology
 adoption shows that the more new technologies a firm adopts, the lower is VET hiring intensity.

 These results show that firm characteristics associated with better performance—size, productivity, and technological
 dynamism—are correlated negatively with VET hiring intensity. The less dynamic firms of Italy include more VET
 graduates in their hiring drives. This may be a factor contributing to the poor earnings and employment profile that
 VET graduates have along the later stages of their professional life.



4.4	       VET graduates and the changing task contents of jobs
           This section uses the EU Labor Force Survey to identify the six types of tasks defined in Chapter
           1 for each worker in the data set. This lets us distinguish the tasks performed by VET graduates
           and compare them with the tasks perform by workers with other education levels—general
           secondary graduates. We then show how the task content of different jobs has changed over the
           last 20 years, partly driven by technology. Finally, we show if and how the tasks performed by VET
           graduates change when firms adopt new technologies.



60      THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
4.4.1	      VET graduates perform manual tasks
                                          Figure 4.9 shows the task intensity of jobs performed by workers with
“The jobs of VET                          different education levels (graduates expressed as a ratio of the country
graduates are                             average). VET graduates’ jobs are, in terms of their task content, like that of
                                          lower secondary graduates and significantly different from that of tertiary

the average job in                        nonroutine cognitive tasks (both analytical and personal), whereas they
                                          are less intensive in routine cognitive tasks and particularly so in manual
the economy, and                          tasks, either routine or nonroutine. The jobs of lower secondary and VET
less intensive in                         graduates follow the opposite pattern: they are more intensive in manual
nonroutine cognitive                      tasks than the average and less intensive in nonroutine cognitive and social
                                          tasks than the average. As for task contents, general secondary graduates’
and social tasks.”                        jobs are between the tertiary graduates’ and those of VET graduates.

            The tasks performed by workers with a VET degree are farther away from the tasks demanded by new
            technologies: social and nonroutine cognitive. Workers with a general secondary education diploma
            (who did not go to university) perform tasks closer to the ones complementing new technologies.
            In terms of labor market advantage in a technology-driven economy, workers with a VET diploma
            do not have an advantage vis-à-vis workers with a general secondary degree; to the contrary, they
            perform tasks similar to those performed by workers that only finished lower secondary.

            Figure 4.10 shows the evolution of the task content of jobs over the last two decades, distinguishing
            between jobs performed by workers with a VET degree versus those performed by all other workers.
            If we concentrate on panel a of Figure 4.10, the nature of jobs has changed significantly over the
            last two decades across the EU. Partly driven by technological progress, jobs have become more
            intensive in nonroutine cognitive tasks and social tasks (Acemoglu & Autor, 2011; Deming, 2017).
            At the same time, they have become less manual. The change in the task content jobs is even
            larger when we reproduce the patterns in panels a and b of Figure 4.10 but among workers aged
            30 to 34 (Figure 4.10, panels c and d). This pattern has been common to all countries in the
            region, except for the trend in routine cognitive tasks, whose intensity in overall employment has
            remained stable in Central and Eastern European countries but has declined in the rest of the EU
            (Keister & Lewandowski, 2017).

Note: this figure plots the evolution of the average task intensity of jobs, indexed to a value of 1 for 2004, for different employment
and age groups across 17 countries in the EU-LFS microdata. The intensity of nonroutine cognitive analytical tasks, nonroutine
cognitive personal tasks, routine cognitive tasks, routine manual tasks and nonroutine manual tasks is calculated using the
procedures detailed in Hardy et al. (2018). The intensity in social tasks is calculated using the definition of Deming (2017) on the use
of social skills in the job. Values are population weighted. Panels a and c correspond to the average values for all employed individuals
excluding VET graduates. Panels b and d correspond to the average values for VET graduates only. NR = Nonroutine. Cog = Cognitive.

“The tasks performed                                 The evolution of the task content of jobs is very different for workers
                                                     with a VET degree, who represent a critical part of the labor force

                                                     at the beginning of their professional life (Figure 4.10, panel d). There

significantly”                                       market, including, as we will show below, technological progress.52

4.4.2	      VET graduates do not perform tasks complementing new technology
            Technology is changing the task content of jobs, increasing the demand for nonroutine cognitive
            analytical and personal tasks. Therefore, a technological shock will result in different labor market
            outcomes across educational groups. Individuals with skills that let them perform nonroutine
            cognitive tasks or social tasks—which complement new technology—will benefit from more firms
            adopting new technology, whereas workers with skills typically used to perform routine and manual
            tasks may experience a loss in labor market opportunities.

            To test the impact of technology on tasks performed by different workers based on their education
            level, we correlate the changes in the task content of jobs of different educational groups over
            the period 2004–19 with the exposure to two technologies—robots and AI—in the early 2000s.53
            We carry out this exploratory analysis at the regional level, covering 95 regions across 8 EU
            countries for which information is available.54 The results are summarized in Figure 4.11. Exposure
            to different technologies is correlated with a subsequent change in the task content of jobs,
            particularly for individuals with tertiary education: a higher exposure to operational technologies
            (such as robotization) in 2000–02 is correlated with an increase in nonroutine cognitive task
            intensity and the use of social tasks, and with a decrease in manual and routine tasks. These
            trends are expected because robots substitute for manual and routine tasks, and they indicate
            that tertiary graduates shift to jobs more intense in complementary tasks or that they remain
            with the same job, but it becomes more intensive in the performance of nonroutine tasks. A similar
            pattern is found for exposure to informational technologies such as software and AI, although the
            overall magnitude of the correlations is smaller. In the case of workers with a VET and general
            secondary education degree, they experience changes in task intensity that mirror the direction
            of those of tertiary graduates but are smaller in magnitude and in some cases, not statistically
            significant. The changes are even less significant for lower secondary graduates in most cases (not
            shown in Figure 4.11).

52 It is important to note that the occupational composition of VET graduates’ jobs in terms of ISCO 1-digit groups has changed, as shown
 by Vandeweyer and Verhagen (2020). In particular, VET graduates are increasingly likely to be employed as services and sales workers and
 decreasingly likely to work as clerical support workers. However, when occupations are decomposed into tasks, this change is strongly attenu-
 ated. This suggests that, while VET graduates may have nominally changed occupations, the tasks they do remain mostly the same.
53 Exposure to technology is defined using the measure created by Webb (2020), which estimates the exposure of each occupation (in the US

 SOC classification) to a given technology using patent information. This measure was adapted to the European occupational classification
 (ISCO-08, ISCO-88), see Box 1.4 for details. The values of all occupations are aggregated to the relevant unit of analysis (sector, region, or
 country) using employment weights of year 2000/02 (that is, the number of individuals employed in a given occupation in the unit of analysis
 in 2000/02). Technological exposure is thus defined as the share of employment exposed to a given technology in year 2000/02.

         Firms that use robots tend to hire VET graduates for jobs less intense in social and nonroutine
         cognitive tasks—and more intense in routine manual tasks—than firms of the same size
         and sector that do not use them. This result seems counterintuitive because it would have
         been expected that robots substitute for routine manual tasks and complement social and
         nonroutine cognitive tasks. But it is important to underline that this is a cross-sectional,
         correlational analysis: what it shows is that the use of robots is correlated with a job structure
         that is more intensive in routine manual tasks for VET graduates. How does this change over
         time? Unfortunately, the limited sample size of the ICT survey precludes doing a meaningful
         event study on the task intensity of VET graduate hires over time. More research will be
         needed to understand the long-term implications of technology adoption on VET graduates’
         jobs at the firm level.

         The analysis in this section shows that tertiary graduates “take the lead” in the transformation
         of jobs following technological change, whereas other education groups, including workers with a
         VET degree, lag. This evidence supports the idea that workers with a VET degree do not have the
         skills to perform tasks complementing recent technological progress. As technology advances
         and is adopted by more firms, and the demand for skills to perform social and nonroutine
         cognitive tasks increases, VET graduates might experience lower labor market outcomes (lower
         employment or wages).

4.4.3	   How green are the jobs performed by VET graduates?
         There is also evidence that VET graduates perform jobs that are pollution intensive and less green
         and hence are at risk of disappearing with the green transition. The transition to a low-carbon
         economy entails massive investments in technology, infrastructure, innovation in production
         models, and will also imply strong changes in the labor market as new jobs will emerge, whereas
         others will be adjusted or replaced (ILO 2016). The green transition has the potential to create
         new and decent jobs while protecting the environment (Ruppert Bulmer & Rutkowski 2021; ILO
         2016; 2018; World Bank 2021). But, the green transition will inevitably destroy employment,
         mainly in fossil fuel and particularly the coal mining sector (ILO 2016).

         The transition to a greener economy will not affect European educational groups similarly.
         Garrote Sanchez and Makovec (2022) provide country-level estimates of the share of “green
         tasks” in jobs and the share of “brown jobs” across countries in the region. Using their methods,
         these same indicators can be estimated for workers with different education levels.

         Following Vona et al. (2018)’s methodology, the share of green tasks is defined as the share of
         time spent working on tasks complying with environmental sustainability; these tasks are those
         specific to green occupations as defined by the O*NET Green Economy program. The share
         of brown jobs is defined as the share of occupations in industries in the United States’ 95th
         percentile of pollution intensity (according to six air pollutants and CO2 emissions). These two
         indicators, although not mutually exclusive, can illustrate how far ahead in the greening process
         different educational groups’ jobs are and how many are expected to be directly hit as emissions
         constraints become more stringent.

            This heterogeneity in the green/brown dimension of VET graduates’ jobs suggests that the
            policies to accommodate the labor market consequences of the greening of the economy may
            need to be country specific. Policies that help labor mobility across sectors may be best suited in
            those countries where the largest exposure is on the brown job dimension, whereas policies that
            emphasize skill training may be best suited in those countries where the largest exposure is on the
            green task dimension.

4.5	        Why are VET graduates not benefiting from technological progress?
            The task content of jobs in the economy is trending in a direction different to that of VET
            graduates’ jobs. However, not in all countries did the task content of VET graduates’ jobs differ
            from that of overall employment in the same way (See Appendix D for country-level patterns of
            the task content of jobs). This heterogeneity in cross-country patterns allows for the exploration
            of its relationship with the characteristics of VET systems across countries, or the role played by
            foundational skills—numeracy, literacy, and socioemotional skills.

4.5.1	      The evolution of task content of VET jobs and the characteristics of the system
            VET systems in the EU differ in many dimensions—two of them being the age of entry into the
            system and the share of work-based learning in the curriculum.55 Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16
            present the average difference in task intensity trends, calculated as the difference between the
            change in task intensity from 2004 and 2019 for overall employment and the same change for
            VET graduates’ employment, for countries grouped by characteristics of their VET system. These
            figures summarize the differences in trends between VET and non-VET graduates presented in
            Figure 4.10 but distinguishing between VET systems with different age of entry and the share
            of work-based learning, respectively. We restrict here to the employment of individuals aged 30
55 Other dimensions are the route of entry into the system (whether voluntary, by selective exam, or by recommendation), the degree of inte-
 gration with non-vocational tracks, the possibilities of continuing into tertiary education, the duration of the programs, and the degree of
 involvement of social partners (business chambers, trade unions, non-government organizations).




                                             CHAPTER 4 – VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN CHANGING LABOR MARKETS                      67
               to 34, as this reflects better the nature of jobs that individuals have at the beginning of their
               professional life, when differences attributable to the type of education may be clearer. A negative
               value shows that VET graduates’ jobs have become less intense in a task when compared to overall
               employment, whereas a positive value shows the opposite. In other words, if the task contents of
               jobs performed by VET graduates evolved on par with those of non-VET workers, the value of the
               bars in Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16 would be zero. Therefore, smaller bars in Figure 4.15 and Figure
               4.16 capture a smaller divergence on the task intensity of jobs performed by VET graduates, and
               larger bars represent a larger divergence.

Note: this figure plots the difference between the change in task intensity over the period 2004–19 for overall employment and the
change in task intensity over the period 2004–19 for VET graduates’ employment, restricting the sample to individuals aged 30 to 34.
The change over the period 2004–19 is expressed respect to an index of task intensity with a value of 1 for 2004 and is calculated
using EU-LFS microdata. A negative value shows that the change for overall employment is higher than for VET graduates’ employment,
whereas a positive value shows the opposite. The values are calculated for each country in the sample separately and then are
aggregated (as a simple average) into three groups based on the age of entry into the VET track: i) early selection, for those where entry
occurs at age 14 or younger, ii) mid-age selection, for those where entry occurs at age 15; iii) late selection, for those where entry occurs
at age 16 or older. NR Cog An. = Nonroutine Cognitive Analytical; NR Cog. Pers. = Nonroutine Cognitive Personal; R Cognitive = Routine

               Figure 4.15 distinguishes three groups of countries based on the age of entry into the VET system:
               early selection at age 14 or younger, mid selection at age 15, and late selection at age 16 or later.56
               No clear pattern emerges, except that the difference between the trends of overall employment
               and VET graduates’ employment seem to be smaller in absolute value for those countries where
               entry occurs at age 15.

               Figure 4.16 groups countries based on the share of work-based learning of their VET system:
               less than 33 percent, between 33 percent and 50 percent, and over 50 percent. The share of
               work-based learning appears to be related to the difference in task content trends. In countries
               where the share of work-based learning in VET is highest—more than 50 percent of the average

           curriculum—the difference is smaller, whereas in countries where work-based learning represents
           less than 33 percent of the average curriculum of VET education, the difference is larger in
           absolute value. In this sense, in countries where VET systems have a high share of work-based
           learning, the task content of jobs of VET graduates has followed more closely the evolution of the
           task content of jobs of the overall employment. This finding resonates with Adao et al. (2023)’s
           analysis of the enrollment in apprenticeships—the type of VET education with the highest share
           of work-based learning—in the German VET system. Their analysis shows that VET students enroll
           in apprenticeships have occupations in high demand in the economy. In this sense, VET systems
           that give students the possibility to learn in the workplace seem to be more effective in allowing
           graduates—at least initially—to access the jobs that the economy is creating. VET systems that
           give a larger role to classroom-based learning may not be as effective in that dimension.

4.5.2	     The importance of foundational skills: literacy and numeracy
           Individuals with higher numeracy and literacy scores in the PIAAC survey are employed in jobs
           with higher nonroutine cognitive task intensity, a higher use of social skills, and a lower manual
           task intensity (Figure 4.17, panel a). A one standard deviation increase in the numeracy score is
           associated with an increase in social task intensity of about 9 percent of the mean, an increase
           in nonroutine cognitive analytical task intensity in the job of about 5.4 percent of the mean,
           an increase in nonroutine cognitive personal task intensity of about 2.7 percent of the mean.

          The effect on routine cognitive task intensity is close to zero but there is also a strong, negative
          association with the intensity of manual tasks—both routine and nonroutine—of a magnitude
          exceeding 7 percent of the mean. A similar pattern is seen with the association between the
          literacy score and the task content of jobs: a higher proficiency in literacy is associated with a
          higher intensity of nonroutine cognitive tasks in the job and particularly social tasks, and a lower
          intensity of manual tasks. The same pattern emerges when focusing on VET graduates: although
          the magnitudes are smaller, a higher numeracy or literacy is associated with a higher intensity in
          social and nonroutine cognitive tasks, and a lower intensity in manual tasks. Cognitive skills are
          thus a fundamental correlate to the employment in jobs intensive in the tasks becoming more
          demanded in the labor market. This applies to all the population—VET graduates as well as general
          secondary and tertiary graduates.

          The divergence between VET graduates’ jobs and overall employment is largest in those tasks
          used in the job by individuals with better foundational skill proficiency, such as social tasks and
          nonroutine cognitive tasks (as shown earlier in Figure 4.9). It is worthwhile exploring whether the
          country-level divergence in the task content of VET graduates’ job is associated with the gap in
          cognitive foundational skills (numeracy and literacy) between VET graduates and the average
          adult population. To this purpose we will use data from the PIAAC survey, classifying countries
          into three groups based on the gap (small, medium, and large) in the numeracy and literacy scores
          between VET graduates and the average adult population in the survey. The patterns of job task
          divergence are plotted in Figure 4.18. In countries where the gap in literacy and numeracy was large,
          the divergence in manual task intensity between VET graduates’ jobs and overall employment was
          largest, both when looking at all age groups (panel a) or only those age 30 to 34 (panel b). When
          looking at cognitive and social tasks, the divergence is smallest for countries where the gap in
          literacy and numeracy is smaller, whereas it is larger for countries where the gap is medium or
          large. This evidence suggests that gaps in cognitive foundational skills could play a role in the
          divergence of labor market trends between VET graduates and overall employment.

Note: this figure plots the difference between the change in task intensity over the period 2004–19 for overall employment and the
change in task intensity over the period 2004–19 for VET graduates’ employment (panel a corresponds to all employees aged 18–65,
panel b corresponds to employees age 30 to 34). The change over the period 2004–19 is expressed respect to an index of task
intensity with a value of 1 for 2004 and is calculated using EU-LFS microdata. A negative value shows that the change for overall
employment is higher than for VET graduates’ employment, whereas a positive value shows the opposite. The values are calculated
for each country in the sample separately, and then are aggregated (as a simple average) into three groups based on the average
gap in literacy and numeracy scores between VET graduates and the average adult population at the country level in PIAAC: i) small,
where the average gap is less than five points, ii) medium, where the average gap is between 5 and 10 points; iii) large, where the
average gap is larger than 10 points. The country sample is restricted to those countries where there is a sufficient sample of VET
graduates in PIAAC.



4.5.3	     The importance of foundational skills: socioemotional skills
           The tasks that imply the use of social skills (namely, the ability to work with others) have increased
           the most in the EU during the last decade and a half (as shown earlier in Figure 4.10). This
           coincides with a similar trend also observed in the United States (Deming, 2017). The reasons for
           this increase are linked to the complementarity of these tasks to the current wave of technological
           change—because both the exposure to operational and informational technologies are correlated
           with the increase in using these tasks (as shown earlier in Figure 4.11). This is also supported by
           case studies of ICT implementation that show it leads to reallocation of workers into flexible,
           team-based settings that facilitate adaptive responses and group problem solving (Autor et al.,
           2002; Bresnahan et al., 2002; Bartel et al., 2007). Social skills, in turn, improve team performance
           (Weidmann and Deming 2021).

           With the increased demand for social skills, there is evidence from the United States that wage
           and employment returns to social skills have also increased. Deming (2017) finds that, between
           the 1980s and the early 2010s, the association between social skills and the probability of full-
           time work has increased more than fourfold, whereas the association with wage gains has almost
           doubled. Experimental evidence shows that better social skills are associated with better labor
           market outcomes (Algan et al., 2022).




                                           CHAPTER 4 – VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN CHANGING LABOR MARKETS               71
        Different from numeracy and literacy, for which the technology to teach and develop them is
        understood, there is still no consensus on how to develop social skills (Deming, 2022). However,
        training programs implemented by VET institutions seem to be able to improve individuals’ soft
        skills. Acevedo et al. (2020) analyze a soft skills training program implemented by VET institutions
        in the Dominican Republic and find that the training improved the soft skills of female participants
        even three and a half years after program completion—particularly in perseverance, organization,
        and social skills—although not necessarily for men. In the short run, soft skill training successfully
        increased employment in higher quality jobs for women but not for men. A similar program carried
        out in Colombia was evaluated by Barrera-Osorio et al. (2023), who find that individuals that
        received training emphasizing social skills maintained a job for a longer time than individuals that
        received a training emphasizing technical skills. These findings apply for both men and women.
        These two studies are, however, among the very few that look into the possibility of developing
        social skills among adults. Algan et al. (2022) analyze a school-based intervention for children aged
        7–9 and show that social skills can be improved earlier in life.

        Deming and Noray (2020) analyze the earning dynamics of college graduates and find those
        majoring in technology-intensive subjects such as computer science, engineering, and business
        tend to have an early earnings premium in their career that dissipates quickly over time, thus
        lowering their return to experience and flattening their age-earning profile—just like the analysis
        for VET graduates using PIAAC data showed before (see Figure 4.5 in Section 4.3 above). The
        main reason for this is that the jobs in which these graduates are employed at the beginnings of
        their careers are also jobs that have a fast rate of skill change, that is, where the skill demands
        of the job change quickly, making any given job-specific skill (say, the ability to use of a particular
        type of software) obsolete quickly. These findings are similar to those of Cnossen et al. (2022),
        who find that VET degrees with a high share of technical content are associated with lower
        earnings. Deming and Noray show that how college graduates with these field specializations
        react to the quick obsolescence of their technical skills is by moving to occupations where these
        skills are less important—namely, managerial occupations. Because performance in managerial
        jobs is correlated with better soft skills, it is crucial for individuals with a technical educational
        background to learn soft skills to ensure better labor market prospects in the long term. The study
        by Cnossen, Piracha and Tchuente shows that VET graduates in the Netherlands from degrees
        with a high curriculum content of social skills have earnings that increase over time, as they
        gradually sort into industries which reward these skills as they go along in their professional life.
        The analysis of Langer and Wiederhold (2023) also points to the increasing returns of social skills
        taught in vocational training, particularly in the last decades. Preliminary evidence from a survey
        among upper-secondary students in Greece shows that vocational education does not seem to
        help the development of soft skills (see Box 4.3), potentially putting vocational track students at
        a disadvantage in a labor market that increasingly values social skills.




72   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
BOX 4.3. Soft skills among upper-secondary vocational students in Greece
Greek employers across sectors increasingly value soft skills (EOPPEP, 2021) including teamwork, interpersonal and
communication skills. Yet VET programs—which are designed specifically to increase graduates’ employability—rarely
target such skills. Students are not adequately equipped with other than professional skills, as generic skills—such as
literacy, working with numbers, teamwork, computer literacy, and communication skills—are neither part of the course
content nor included in extra-curricular activities of VET structures. A recent survey, covering over 400 employers and
around 4,800 VET graduates, was conducted by the National Organization for the Certification of Qualifications and
Vocational Guidance (EOPPEP), to monitor the progress of vocational education graduates in the Greek labor market.
This study indicated that the highest skills mismatch is in soft rather than in professional and technical skills (EOPPEP,
2021). However, little is known about the actual proficiency in soft skills among vocational graduates.
To fill this knowledge gap, as part of this report, the World Bank and the Foundation for Economic and Industrial
Research (IOBE) carried out a survey to assess the proficiency in socioemotional skills among 1,400 upper-secondary
students in vocational and general tracks in the metropolitan areas of Athens and Thessaloniki during March–May
2023 (IOBE, 2023). The survey relied on a Greek adaptation of the Behavioral, Emotional, and Social Skills Inventory
(BESSI) instrument created by Soto et al. (2022). By way of a self-assessment, this instrument allows to measure the
proficiency in five social, emotional, and behavioral skill domains: self-management, social engagement, cooperation,
emotional resilience, and innovation.
Preliminary results of the survey show that vocational and general students have a similar self-assessed proficiency
in self-management (Figure B4.3.1, panel a) and social engagement (Figure B4.3.1, panel b), whereas statistically
significant differences exist in cooperation (Figure B4.3.1, panel c), emotional resilience (Figure B4.3.1, panel d), and
innovation (Figure B4.3.1, panel e). In particular, cooperation and innovation among vocational track students seems
to be lower than among general track students, whereas emotional resilience seems to be higher.

     Source: World Bank-IOBE survey on socioemotional skills in upper-secondary students in Greece. Preliminary data.


 Note: this figure plots the distribution of the BESSI score (on a 1–5 scale, where 1 indicates lowest proficiency and 5 indicates
 highest proficiency) in five domains for general track students (green line) and vocational track students (orange line). The vertical
 dashed lines indicate the mean score for the general track (green) and for the vocational track (orange). The asterisks indicate
 whether the difference in the means is statistically significant (* at the 10 percent level, ** at the 5 percent level, *** at the
 1 percent level). The preliminary data used for this analysis includes 1,410 students (799 students in the general track and 611
 students in the vocational track) from the first and third grade of upper secondary (781 students in the first grade and 632
 students in the third grade).

 Part of these differences could be explained by the gender composition of the students in each track—girls make up 48
 percent of the students in the general track and 37 percent of the students in the vocational track—and differences in
 their social backgrounds—vocational track students tend to have lower socioeconomic status than students in the general
 track. When controlling for these factors, the average differences between both tracks disappear in most domains.

 The survey results show, however, an important difference between the vocational and general track: in the vocational
 track, the soft skill scores are not different between students in the first and the last year of upper secondary; in the
 general track, the scores in most domains are higher in the last year than in the first one. These patterns suggest
 that a general track education seems to help the development of soft skills among students, whereas a vocational
 track education has no effect.




4.6	         The long-term effects of school track choice: evidence from the
             academic literature
             As seen in the previous sections of this chapter, the choice of school track—either general/
             academic or vocational/technical—can be associated with significant differences in labor market
             outcomes. However, differences in school track can simply reflect differences in socioeconomic
             background or cognitive abilities, which may be ultimately the driving factors of labor market
             outcomes. Several studies have aimed at understanding whether school track per se has a causal
             effect on earnings and employment in the long term. Because of the method used, which requires
             controlling for many factors that affect school choice, these studies focus on specific country
             settings and cannot explain differences across countries.

             A first set of studies looks at the long-term impact of school choice on marginal students, that
             is, students on the margins or indifferent between going to the general or the vocational tracks.
             Dustmann et al. (2017) look at the case of Germany and study the long-term education and
             labor market outcomes of students on the margin between general and vocational tracks because



74        THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
of their date of birth. Students born before the cutoff date for school enrollment reach the end
of primary school at an earlier age than students born right after the cutoff date. This, in turn,
translates into a lower probability of attending a general track school in middle school, and a higher
probability of attending a vocational track. Their analysis shows that, for these students, the
school track choice does not have a long-term impact on their educational attainment and labor
market outcomes. They explain this null effect on the school system in Germany being flexible
enough to allow for changes in track choice during middle and high school, and that students
who are “misallocated” at the beginning of middle school can change tracks later on. Birkelund
and van de Werfhorst (2022) look at the case of Denmark and study the effect of going into a
vocational track for those students whose choice of track responds to their peers’ track choice. In
particular, they study the effect on two types of marginal students—those on the margin between
an academic and a vocational track, and those on the margin between a vocational track and
dropping out of school. They find that, for the first set of students, choosing an academic track
over a vocational track does not lead to higher earnings or higher employment rates at age 40,
but only affects the occupation—less intensive in manual work than for vocational track students.
For the second set of students, they find that choosing a vocational track over dropping out of
school leads to higher earnings and higher employment rates at age 40. Matthewes and Ventura
(2022) look at the same two choices—between academic and vocational, and between vocational
and drop out—in England but using a different margin—that of geographical distance. Differently
to the study in Denmark, they find that enrolling in a vocational track school (as opposed to
an academic track school) substantially decreases earnings at age 30, whereas for those that
enroll in a vocational track instead of dropping out the impact on earnings is positive but small.
Silliman and Virtanen (2022) analyze the pool of students in the margin between general and
vocational tracks in Finland (where tracking occurs at a late stage, at age 16) and find that those
who end up in the vocational track because of oversubscription of their preferred choice see a
positive difference in earnings but no difference in employment at least until age 37 vis-à-vis those
students of the same pool who end up in the general track. The authors claim that one reason for
the lack of a negative effect of vocational track on earnings is marginal vocational track students
enrolling in higher education at the same rate as marginal general track students, something
that is possible in the Finnish education system (which allows vocational graduates to go into
university) Last, Borghans et al. (2019) look at school track choice in Netherlands for students
who are around the cutoff score of the achievement test that places students in different tracks.
In their setting there are four tracks, which are ordered from a “lowest” vocational track to a
“highest” academic track (pre-university) with two middle tracks (lower general and higher general)
in between. They find that students that end up in a higher track (either at the lowest end of the
track choice, between vocational and lower general, or at the top end of the track choice, between
higher general and pre-university) have higher earnings in the long run, whereas students that end
up in the higher track in the middle rank of track choices (that is, they attend the higher general
instead of the lower general track) have lower earnings in the long run.

A second set of studies look at inframarginal students, that is, students who a priori are set to
choose a specific track in a given educational system rather than being indifferent between them.
These studies rely mostly on institutional differences in the educational system as the source of
exogenous variation to identify the long-term effects of school track choice. Malamud and Pop-
Eleches (2010) look at the case of Romania, where an educational reform in 1973 delayed entrance
to vocational schools and extended general education. They find that, in the long run, men with
more years of general education than vocational because of the reform were less likely to work
in manual or craft-related occupations, but had similar levels of labor market participation and



                          CHAPTER 4 – VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN CHANGING LABOR MARKETS   75
        earnings (similar results hold for women, who were otherwise not affected substantially by the
        reform). Their analysis still does not include information on the labor market outcomes of the
        first fifteen years of professional life. Zilic (2018) analyzes the long-term effects (over thirty years
        later) of a reform in 1975–78 in Croatia (which was at the time part of socialist Yugoslavia) that
        extended the general curriculum for students attending vocational training. He finds no long-term
        effects on labor market outcomes but does find heterogeneous effects across genders in terms
        of educational attainment: men in vocational training that received more general education saw
        a reduced educational attainment in the long term, whereas for women there were no effects.
        The 1999 educational reform in Poland, which delayed tracking by a year, was shown to improve
        student academic performance—as measured by PISA scores—particularly among vocational
        students (Jacubowski et al., 2016)and increased employment probability by 3 percent and earnings
        by 4–5 percent on average (Drucker et al., 2022). A similar reform that delayed the separation into
        vocational and general education by two years in France is studied by Canaan (2020). She finds that
        the reform raised individuals’ level of education and increased their wages by 6 percent at ages 40
        to 45, and that these effects are concentrated among men and individuals from low socioeconomic
        backgrounds. Guyon et al. (2012) look at the effect of a reform in Northern Ireland’s educational
        system that increased the number of students that could attend the secondary school track that
        leads to university (grammar schools). By comparing cohorts of students affected and not affected
        by this reform, they identify the effect of attending an academic track school for students who
        would previously could not go to one because of their academic achievement. They find that, for
        these students, attending an academic track increases their educational attainment in the long run.
        Matthewes (2021) exploits institutional differences across German states to investigate the effects
        of going into a single, comprehensive non-academic track vs. going into an intermediate or a lower
        non-academic track—the former providing further access to the academic track, and the latter
        only providing access to the intermediate, non-academic track. He finds that students with low
        achievement in primary school have a higher achievement later in their education when they go to a
        single, comprehensive track that when their placed into a lower track. Higher achieving students are
        not affected by attending a single, comprehensive track instead of a differentiated one.

                                               Last, it is worth mentioning the study of Golsteyn and Stenberg
        “The literature                        (2017), who look at the lifetime earnings and employment
        shows that, in most                    profile of vocational and general track graduates in Sweden.

76   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
    (such as geography, date of birth, slot availability, or social circle), the difference between attending
    an academic track school and a vocational one is not clear because some factors are associated
    with a positive difference and others with a non-significant or negative one. In this sense, the
    differences in labor market outcomes between general and academic track graduates cannot
    be fully explained by selection into tracks on the basis of ability but, rather, they may be partly
    explained by the school tracks themselves.


4.7	Summary
    VET systems are critical for productivity and inclusion in Europe. Almost half of the students
    enrolled in upper secondary in EU member states attend a VET institution—most of these
    students have a disadvantaged background. European countries invest considerable resources in
    VET systems—more than for the average general track student—mostly under the assumption
    that these systems provide better labor market opportunities for their graduates.

    The analysis presented in this chapter raises serious doubts about this assumption. VET graduates
    have an initial employment advantage vis-à-vis general track graduates who do not pursue further
    education, but they lose this advantage a few years after entering the labor market. The earning
    profile of VET graduates as they age is flatter than that of general secondary graduates, suggesting
    lower returns to experience, and leading overall to lower labor market earnings. The task content of
    VET graduates’ jobs is not a complement to recent technological progress because they are more
    intensive in manual tasks and less intensive in social and nonroutine cognitive tasks. This lack of
    complementarity with technology is clear in the increased divergence of the task content of VET
    graduates’ jobs from that of the rest of the economy: VET graduates’ jobs have not changed in
    more than a decade and a half, whereas the rest of the employment—including general secondary
    graduates’ jobs—has become more intensive in social and nonroutine cognitive tasks and less
    intensive in manual tasks.

    The divergence in the patterns of task contents of VET graduate jobs with respect to the rest
    of the economy is smaller in countries where the VET system has a large share of work-based
    learning. But cognitive foundational skills explain also this divergence: the wider the gap in literacy
    and numeracy (and, possibly, in socioemotional skills) between VET graduates and the rest of the
    adults in the population, the larger the divergence in the task content of jobs.

    Although the analysis in this chapter is based on conditional correlations, and the results cannot
    be interpreted as causally driven by enrollment into either general or vocational track, the emerging
    patterns coincide with the academic literature providing causal evidence on the effects of school
    track choice at the country level, which indicate that vocational track students do not necessarily
    have better long-term prospects than if they had attended a general or academic track school.

    As in any regional analysis, the patterns found at the aggregate level may not represent specific
    country contexts. VET systems across and within countries are heterogeneous, and in some cases
    their performance may be better than in others. However, the regional patterns are indicative of
    general trends and point to the dimensions where policy reforms are needed.

78   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
Technological advances have constantly disrupted the economy since the industrial revolution.
With every advance, old methods are replaced by new and better ways of doing things, resulting
in creative destruction and economic growth. However, the transition from the old to the new state
of the economy inevitably creates winners and losers, affecting how income is distributed between
labor and capital, across different regions, and among workers with varying skills. The distributional
impacts of technology can cause anxiety among those who are likely to be negatively affected. This
report aims to enhance our comprehension of the distributional effects of technological progress
by identifying how it affects firms’ productivity, market concentration, regional disparities, and
differences in labor market outcomes among workers with varying education levels.

This report brings together two areas of research that rarely intersect: the analysis of the effect of
technology on firm productivity and the demand for different skills, and the influence of education
systems on the supply of skills needed in the technological transition. By combining these fields, we
can pinpoint the crucial role that human capital plays in technology adoption and the significant
impact that technology has on rendering specific skills obsolete or in demand.

This report addresses two specific challenges brought about by technological progress in the EU:

   1.	 Market concentration: creative destruction enhances a company’s productivity and market
       share, paving the way for further technological advancements. Unfortunately, this process
       often leaves small businesses in less developed areas behind and can increase market
       concentration. Workers receive a smaller portion of the national income when a few large
       companies control a larger market share. Those who own capital in those large firms profit
       from this equilibrium, but it may not benefit the average worker. In addition, technology
       adoption usually concentrates in better-off areas with better conditions. This results in a
       disparity in income distribution, leaving less developed regions behind.

   2.	 Income dispersion: Technology affects firms by changing their organization, workers’ tasks, and
       the workforce’s required skills. Individuals with more education have skills that complement
       technological advancements, enabling them to benefit from the changes. However, those
       with less education do not have this advantage, increasing income disparities between
       people with different education levels. The novel results in this report show that, through
       the channels described above, technology stimulates economic growth in the EU but at the
       cost of more income disparities.

Relying on market forces to drive technology adoption and addressing its challenges through
redistribution policies like taxes and transfers may seem theoretically sound but is ultimately
unrealistic and naive. To achieve a fair and inclusive process of technological change, policies must
ensure an equal distribution of technology’s benefits. Simply relying on ex post redistribution will
not be enough to overcome the challenges posed by the latest technological innovations. Economic
systems that provide equal opportunities for all individuals to participate in and benefit from
markets—what Acemoglu and Robinson (2012) define as inclusive institutions—create a virtuous
cycle of technology, shared prosperity, and innovation. The main point conveyed in this report is the
pressing necessity to formulate and execute supplementary policies that guarantee widespread
and equitable advantages from technological advancements.




                                                             CHAPTER 5 – POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS    79
        In this section, we present policy recommendations to promote inclusive institutions and optimize
        technology’s positive impact on human wellbeing. We categorize these recommendations into two
        groups: those that directly stem from the empirical findings of this report and those that are
        informed by other relevant studies but still pertain to the two challenges mentioned above.

Promoting technology adoption among small and younger firms with a
focus on lagging regions
        Our analysis, based on data from Italy’s firms, reveals that larger and more productive companies in
        more advanced areas with available financial resources and human capital are more likely to adopt
        new technologies. This adoption of technology increases the productivity and size of the firms, and
        this can exacerbate market concentration. To prevent further market concentration and reduce
        the impact of technology on regional gaps, both the EU and governments of EU member states
        could introduce policies that promote the adoption of new technologies among small businesses,
        with a special focus on those in lagging regions. We identify four main policy recommendations.

                            First, policies must address the deficiency of complementary inputs, specifically
                            managerial capabilities and organizational structure. A weakness prevalent
“Policies should            especially among smaller enterprises, many of which tend to be family instead
not just promote            than professionally managed (Iacovone et al, 2019; Bloom et al 2021). An
“technology                 emerging literature pioneered by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) has pointed to the
                            importance of managerial and organizational capabilities as crucial conditions for
drops” but must             taking advantage of the opportunities offered by modern information technologies
address the                 (Bloom, Sadun and Van Reenen 2012). In line with this idea, Brynjolfsson et al.
deficiency of               (2021) have recently shown how intangible investments (for example, in managerial
                            capacities and workers’ skills) play a crucial role in enabling the benefits from
complementary               general-purpose technologies such as IT. The consequent policy recommendation
inputs,                     is that policies should not just promote “technology drops” but create incentives for
specifically                making these complementary investments, such as improving managerial practices
                            and organization. More at the regional level, our analysis points to the importance
managerial                  of external factors as key drivers of technology adoption. Based on the Italian case
capabilities and            study, we find how adoption is much weaker in lagging regions, regions characterized
organizational              by deficiencies in those key external factors that drive technology adoption: access
                            to finance, availability of skilled workers, enabling business environments. The policy
structure.”                 agenda to promote technology adoption, especially in lagging regions, needs to
                            focus on addressing these enabling and complementary factors.

                            Second, market fragmentation in Europe presents a substantial barrier, especially for
                            SMEs, and requires renewed attention. Despite strides toward market integration,
“Market                     the European market remains notably fragmented, particularly in the service
fragmentation in            sectors upon which many manufacturing businesses are dependent. (For example,
Europe presents             the retail sector is key for firms producing for final consumers.) This fragmentation
                            is due to a mix of regulatory and non-regulatory hurdles. As suggested by the
a substantial               recent European Single Digital Market report, Europe’s critical agenda is enhancing
barrier, especially         integration to ensure a fully operational single market. This integration is especially
for SMEs, and               important for SMEs because their smaller scale makes the fixed costs of transacting
                            across borders especially onerous. The key message is that the complexities and
requires renewed            uncertainties arising from disparate market rules, regulatory barriers, and standards
attention”                  across countries can deter SMEs from embracing new technologies.




80   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
Third, EU governments need to carefully promote competition and market contestability. The new
digital economy, particularly with the advent of advanced AI, requires a renewed focus on antitrust
policy. As discussed by Goolsbee (2018), the concentration of market power in technology-driven
industries can resemble the consolidation of industries during the original Gilded Age. To prevent
the emergence of monopolistic or highly concentrated markets, policymakers should prioritize
competition policy interventions. First, policymakers need to carefully assess the impact of fixed
costs, economies of scale, and network externalities on market concentration. Although these
factors can lead to winner-takes-all outcomes, it is crucial to identify potential anticompetitive
behavior and make sure market power does not hinder competition or innovation. This initiative may
involve targeted regulations or guidelines to promote fair competition and market contestability.
Second, maintaining a competitive landscape in the modern information economy, especially in
the context of the quick emergence of advanced AI, requires ongoing scrutiny of dominant players
and potential antitrust violations. Policymakers should actively monitor mergers and acquisitions,
ensuring they do not result in monopolistic control or anticompetitive practices. Additionally,
competition authorities should have the resources and expertise to analyze complex information
and technology-driven markets effectively.

A complement to the focus on competition and contestability is a novel approach to safeguarding
data rights and consumers’ privacy. Because the information economy relies heavily on data,
policymakers must address concerns surrounding access and of personal information. In line with
the ideas proposed by Goolsbee (2019), we suggest that it is crucial to establish regulations that
restrict certain behaviors and practices driven by asymmetric market power. First, policymakers
should consider implementing restrictions on access to consumers’ information and determine
what are acceptable ways in which companies can collect, store, and use customer information by
focusing on keeping an even playing field between larger companies, with the capacity to generate
and obtain large quantities of data on consumers and demand, and smaller firms or startups
that may lack these capacities and be unable to compete. Clear guidelines are needed to define
the ownership and sharing of consumers’ data while safeguarding privacy. Second, policymakers
should explore policies against various forms of price discrimination. Discriminatory pricing
practices, enabled by big data processing and AI algorithms, can lead to market distortions and
unfair treatment of consumers, plus exacerbate market power asymmetries. Regulators should
develop frameworks to make sure price discrimination does not result in discriminatory outcomes
or hinder competition.

Last, there is a pressing need for improved measurement of technology adoption. The status quo
is highly unsatisfactory because current statistical information available (the Survey for ICT Usage
among Enterprises) treats firms as black boxes and provides generic information on technology
adoption at the extensive margin (for example, whether a firm adopts a certain technology or
not) but does not provide information on how this technology is used (for example, technology
for what? For managing customers or suppliers? Or internal processes?) and does not tell us the
intensity with which this technology is used. The World Bank’s Technology Adoption Survey (TAS)
could serve as an instrumental tool in this context. As implemented already in two EU member
states (Poland and Croatia), the TAS offers detailed firm-level data on the extent of technology
adoption and usage, thereby facilitating the creation of a comparable measure of technology
sophistication. The survey identifies the purpose of technologies adopted by a firm, measures
the technologies the firm adopted and uses most frequently, and can be aggregated by country,




                                                            CHAPTER 5 – POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS    81
            region, sector, or specific business function. The TAS builds on global best practices in terms of
            surveys to measure technology in a granular way such as the Advanced Technologies Adoption and
            Use by Firms implemented by the US Census Bureau.57,58


Adapting technology to meet the needs of society
            Our research indicates that companies in Europe that implemented technology have increased the
            demand for nonroutine cognitive tasks while decreasing the demand for routine and manual tasks.
            Highly educated employees have reaped the benefits of technological adoption, as their skill sets
            enable them to perform nonroutine cognitive tasks effectively. However, workers with VET degrees
            have not seen significant changes in their job tasks in the past two decades. Although we have
            treated technological innovations as exogenous in this report, they are actually shaped by context,
            incentives, and government intervention. Therefore, policymakers can shape technological progress
            to complement, rather than replace, workers with low levels of education (including VET graduates).

“To promote job creation                               To promote job creation and good employment opportunities,
                                                       it is crucial to remove disincentives that prioritize capital
and good employment                                    investment over investment in workers. Several countries in
opportunities, it is crucial                           the EU have tax policies that unintentionally subsidize capital
to remove disincentives                                and investment while placing a burden on employment. These
                                                       policies make automation more lucrative, leading to increased
that prioritize capital                                use of machines and research. By readjusting tax incentives to
investment over                                        favor labor-intensive investment, we can create a more conducive
investment in workers.”                                environment for quality employment and job growth.

            In addition, it is important for policies to focus on redirecting technological advancements
            toward activities that integrate labor back into the production process. Autor (2022) highlights
            the significance of public policies in shaping innovation and technology to complement the skills
            of the workforce. Countries can make sure their innovation systems benefit a wider range of
            individuals and regions by increasing and targeting investments in research and development
            (R&D) and reviving their programs (Gruber & Johnson, 2019). Furthermore, aligning tax policies
            with the interests of workers and addressing social challenges can further enhance the impact of
            innovation on job creation and inclusive growth.

            The impact of technology on markets, firms, and society is greatly shaped by the policies and
            institutions in place. According to Autor et. al. (2022c), the adverse effects of technological
            change on labor markets in Europe are less severe compared to those in the United States, partly
            due to their different labor market policies and institutions. Labor unions and stricter minimum
            wage requirements give workers more bargaining power and help moderate the negative effects
            of technology on labor markets.59 Additionally, social insurance and assistance programs for
            unemployed workers can aid in navigating job transitions and mitigate the negative effects of
            technology adoption. Tax systems also play a crucial role in driving technological development and
            its impact on society, as they provide incentives for labor and capital.

59 Focusing on workers that mainly perform routine tasks, Parolin (2020) shows that union membership affects the likelihood that a routine

 worker (1) remains employed in a routine job for a longer duration of time, (2) avoids unemployment, and (3) achieves higher earnings over
 time relative to non-unionized routine workers.

       Based on our findings, individuals with a VET degree are more likely to work in companies that need
       updating, are relatively old, and are unproductive. The task content of the VET graduates’ jobs
       has remained essentially unchanged over the past two decades and involves many manual tasks
       susceptible to being replaced by automation. Moreover, only a small fraction of VET graduates are
       employed in environmentally sustainable roles, whereas a significant percentage work in industries
       with high CO2 emissions, leaving them vulnerable to job loss during the green transition.

       Modernizing VET systems is essential to promote Europe’s growth and inclusion agendas. Half of
       the future workforce in Europe is enrolled in VET schools, a group mostly comprising disadvantaged
       youth with inadequate foundational skills (numeracy, literacy, and socioemotional skills). These
       limitations restrict their capacity to perform nonroutine cognitive tasks, ultimately reducing their
       potential gains from technological advancements. It is critical that European education systems
       provide all graduates, regardless of their chosen path, with fundamental skills. This can be done
       by implementing a basic core curriculum shared among all upper-secondary education tracks,
       including VET programs. The practice of tracking, which involves placing students into either VET
       or general secondary school based on an examination, should be reassessed. Studies show that
       relaxing the tracking restriction and increasing the number of students pursuing the academic
       track could have positive effects on their education and employment prospects.

       According to our research, the cost of producing a VET graduate is 15 percent higher than that
       of a general secondary education graduate. However, VET graduates only have an advantage
       in employment for the first 5–7 years after entering the workforce. Our findings also reveal
       that the task content of jobs held by VET graduates has remained largely unchanged over the
       past 20 years, which can be attributed in part to lower levels of numeracy and literacy among
       VET graduates.

“VET systems face the                   In today’s job market, the importance of foundational skills
                                        cannot be overstated. With rapid advancements in technology
challenge of preparing                  and increased global trade, job turnover is high, and job tenure is
students with relevant                  low. Staying in the same job for an extended period is increasingly
professional skills that                rare. As a result, VET systems face the challenge of preparing
                                        students with relevant professional skills that will remain useful
will remain useful in                   in a fast-changing job market. Balancing the supply and demand
a fast-changing job                     of skills is challenging, and predicting the skills that will be in
market.”                                demand in the future is nearly impossible.

       Improving foundational skills can be expensive, but effective policies can enhance cognitive
       foundational skills like numeracy and literacy. Research shows that smaller class sizes, better
       school facilities, and more instructional time have reliable impacts on cognitive skill development
       (Deming, 2022). The most effective inputs include high-dosage tutoring, extra instructional time,
       personalized instruction, teaching to the right level, and structured pedagogy for teachers). These
       interventions are cost-effective and do not require reinventing the learning process (Akyeampong
       et al., 2023). However, it is crucial for any intervention aiming to improve foundational skills to
       have coherence in approach among different actors and policies in the educational system (World
       Bank, 2018).



                                                                   CHAPTER 5 – POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS   83
          Having foundational skills is essential for continuing to learn, adapting to changes in the job
          market, and reinventing oneself. Although general secondary graduates are in a better position than
          VET graduates, low foundational skills are still a relevant challenge in many EU member states,
          especially lagging ones. Although it is important to equip workers with professional competencies
          demanded by the labor market through ALMPs, the absence of foundational skills may limit their
          benefits. Research shows that most ALMPs have a modest effect on labor market outcomes (see
          Box 5.1); however, making sure all beneficiaries have minimum foundational skills could increase the
          effectiveness of ALMPs. Additionally, if foundational skills are adequately taught in collaboration
          with business associations and prospective employers, a shift away from classroom-based learning
          toward work-based learning could help VET graduates follow labor market demand more closely.
          Foundational skills are also necessary for lifelong learning and upskilling, enabling workers to adapt
          to rapidly evolving technologies and changing job requirements.

 BOX 5.1. Policies beyond formal education: ALMPs

 ALMPs refer to a set of public policies with the common goal of enhancing the labor market participation and
 opportunities of beneficiaries (that is, their employment or earnings). ALMPs can be classified into three types
 according to the side of the labor market which their interventions address: i) labor supply side interventions
 (for example, skills training); ii) labor demand-side interventions (for example, wage subsidies); iii) labor market
 intermediation interventions (for example employment services).

 Among supply-side interventions, one of the most popular are short-term vocational/professional skills trainings.
 These vocational trainings are often delivered in combination with non-vocational trainings (for example, soft skills).
 These programs take place outside the educational system, usually after completion (or drop-out) of secondary
 school. Common interventions within these programs are subsidized classroom-based training and placement in
 workplace-based training (including firm-based training and internships). A systematic literature review and meta-
 analysis by Kemper et al. (2022) covering 89 studies globally finds that youth-targeted vocational training tends
 to have an economically meaningful impact on labor market outcomes. The size of the impact does not depend on
 country income level, implying that well-designed interventions can work irrespective of labor market challenges.
 Another qualitative literature review of 28 randomized evaluations of apprenticeships and skills training programs
 in LMIC reports overall mixed impacts (JPAL 2023). The reviewers find that programs which included practical
 experience, soft skills training, and job referrals increased hours worked and earnings. Card et al. (2018) find that
 training programs tend to have larger, positive average effects in the medium and longer run, whereas they may have
 small or negative effects in the short run.

 Another common type of supply-side interventions is entrepreneurship promotion programs. These programs
 typically provide nascent or recent entrepreneurs support through business skill training, business advice, access
 to finance, and access to markets or value chains. A literature review and meta-analysis by McKenzie (2017) finds
 that the standard entrepreneurship training programs yield, on average, only modest increases in profits and sales.


 Labor market intermediation interventions aim to improve the match between labor supply and demand. The most
 common labor market intermediation interventions are employment service programs. Evidence reviews suggest
 that employment services tend to have stronger effects in the short run (Vooren et al., 2019, ILO & World Bank,
 2023). Programs that emphasize “work first” by providing incentives to enter work quickly tend to have a similar
 effect both in the short and in the long run (Card et al., 2018). Caliendo and Schmidl (2016) find that job search
 assistance programs show a similar effectiveness for youth as they do for the overall working population. However,
 Kluve et al. (2019) and ILO & World Bank (2023) find that impacts on youth labor market outcomes are rather small
 relative to other ALMPs. At the same time, employment services programs tend to be the least costly ALMPs (Levi
 Yeyati et al., 2019). This suggests that low-cost intermediation programs could be cost-effective, despite their small
 overall effects.




84     THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
Among labor demand-side interventions, private sector employment and public sector employment incentives are
the most common. Private sector employment incentives are typically provided as wage subsidies, paid to either the
firm or the worker. Evidence reviews suggest that private sector employment programs have only a small effect on
labor market outcomes in the short run, but the impact increases over time (Card et al., 2018, Vooren et al. 2019). A
more positive assessment of subsidized employment is given in the meta-analysis by Levi Yeyati et al. (2019), who
find that wage subsidies have the largest positive effect among 102 ALMP interventions analyzed.

Public sector employment programs (often called public works programs (PWPs)) are mostly short-term direct
employment programs and sometimes longer-term employment guarantee programs. Evidence reviews suggest
that public sector employment programs have the least positive impacts on labor market outcomes of participants
relative to other ALMP. Vooren et al. (2019) find that PWPs only have a positive effect on labor market outcomes
after 36 months. According to Card et al. (2018), PWPs are ineffective at all time horizons.

Overall, the evidence from impact evaluations suggests that ALMPs have moderate impacts on average (Kluve et
al., 2019; Card et al., 2018). Comparing among the range of ALMPs, labor supply-side interventions seem to have the
most positive effects (especially skills training programs) followed by private sector employment incentives. At the
same time, these programs also tend to be the costliest on average (McKenzie, 2017; ILO & World Bank, 2023). Labor
market intermediation interventions (for example, employment services) tend to have small or negligible effects,
especially in the longer term. But they are also often less costly than other ALMPs. Public work programs seem to
have a zero or negative impact on labor market outcomes and often comparatively high costs.

The evidence of ALMPs suggests that tailoring specific design elements to the context matters more than the type
of ALMP (Kluve et al., 2019). Evidence suggests that multi-pronged programs, combining different intervention types,
have a higher chance of success (Kluve et al., 2019). However, there is a lack of comparable rigorous cost-benefit
studies that would allow for a comparison of cost-effectiveness across different types of ALMPs.



The future holds many possibilities yet to be defined
         Technology, much like the Roman god Janus, has two faces. One represents its endless ingenuity
         which has historically led to unprecedented levels of human wellbeing and opened up possibilities
         for our societies that were previously unthinkable. Technology expands our productive capabilities
         and generates new tasks and jobs. It can complement our abilities, enhance our capacities and
         overcome our human limitations. However, the other face of technology represents its destructive
         power, which can lead to the substitution of workers and the elimination of jobs, occupations,
         firms, or entire sectors.




                                                                           CHAPTER 5 – POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS       85
 BOX 5.2. Promoting technology in an inclusive manner
 The choice that societies make determine crucially how technology is incorporated by firms and how it shapes
 society. One example of a country that has succeeded at achieving a virtuous cycle between technology, shared
 prosperity, and innovation is Estonia. Despite its size, Estonia has emerged as one of the most technologically
 advanced societies in the world by making significant progress in its levels of digital technology adoption. Estonia
 ranked first in 2021 and 2022 based on the Emerging Europe’s IT Competitiveness Index60 which ranks 23 countries
 across Central and Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus. Three key areas should be highlighted to understand the
 success of Estonia. First, its education system with a strong focus on foundational skills, math and science, which
 has led to a high and equitable performance based on the recent PISA scores. Relatedly, Estonia has integrated
 use of technology into education from early age making technology a force for equalizing access and providing
 opportunities. Second, the digitalization of government services has provided a strong incentive and led the way for
 promoting the adoption of digital technologies. Third, its promotion of innovation and entrepreneurial activity, which
 have led Tallin, its capital, to be named the “Silicon Valley of Europe,” as shown by the creation of globally well-known
 startups such as Skype and TransferWise. Estonia with its policies has made its tech sectors an engine of growth
 and job creation, that critically contributes to its shared prosperity.


            Like any human creation, technology’s dual nature is not inherent. We shape its evolution, define its
            goals, and consider its impact on society. We must also determine the speed at which technological
            advancements will reshape markets and affect income distribution among regions, households, and
            individuals—making sure disadvantaged groups do not bear the burden of unregulated technology
            solely governed by the market. Estonia, for instance, provide an example of a European country
            that has deployed proactive policies that have promoted the diffusion of digital technology in a
            manner that also supports inclusion and equity (See box 5.2).

            Although it is important to focus on improving fundamental skills and optimizing the effectiveness
            of ALMPs, these endeavors may require significant time. Meanwhile, technology will continue to
            advance. Therefore, social assistance policies, particularly implementing a guaranteed minimum
            income (GMI), will be crucial in mitigating the negative effects of technology’s disruptive impact. The
            EU’s social rights framework marks a significant advancement in establishing inclusive institutions,
            but several member states, particularly those that are less developed, still have inadequate coverage
            of vulnerable populations and insufficient cash transfer amounts in their GMI programs.

            To advance the modernization of VET systems, enhance the efficacy of ALMPs, and reinforce
            GMIs, any required reforms must be grounded in evidence and exhibit the intended impact. Despite
            the EU’s demonstrated political dedication to establishing inclusive institutions and allocating
            adequate resources for carrying out social policies and interventions, there is not enough evidence
            regarding the effectiveness of these policies and interventions. It is vital to demonstrate the
            effectiveness of social policies to make sure everyone is included in the digital transition and that
            technology does not worsen the already prevalent income inequality.

            Neglecting to prioritize technology’s role in addressing urgent social needs or failing to improve
            social services for disadvantaged groups due to poorly designed policies or lack of concern for
            measuring its impact may exacerbate income disparities. Such distributional tensions could
            aggravate political polarization, ultimately putting both the technological shift and the larger
            liberal agenda at risk.

Controlling for the simultaneous adoption of multiple technologies
            Controlling for the simultaneous adoption of multiple technologies reduces the magnitude of
            the effects but does not change the qualitative conclusions drawn from the analysis. As firms
            increase their technological sophistication, they can sometimes simultaneously adopt a bundle
            of technologies. A simple difference-in-difference estimate built around the adoption of single
            technology can thus pick up the effect of other technologies being adopted simultaneously by
            the firm. The estimated effect of adoption changes when the difference-in-difference estimate
            controls for the simultaneous adoption of multiple technologies. Figure A.1 shows that, even after
            controlling for simultaneous adoption, for most technologies the estimated effect of adoption
            on sales remains strong and qualitatively similar. The only exception is cybersecurity. The effect
            of this technology effectively disappears after controlling for the simultaneous adoption of
            other technologies. The magnitude of effect of the adoption of other technologies is reduced
            by between 33 and 53 percent but remains strong and statistically significant—except for 3d
            printing technologies. Figure A.2 also shows that, by 2019, the difference in the estimated effect
            with and without simultaneous adoption controls loses importance in relative terms. In 2019, the
            point estimate with controls is only 4 percent and 10 percent lower for the adoption of big data
            analytics and robots, respectively.

100      THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
APPENDIX B
Data Sources and Definitions for Chapter 4
    The empirical analysis of Chapter 4 relies on three data sources: the PISA, the PIAAC, and the
    European Union Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS). This appendix details the definitions used to classify
    individuals by educational group in each of these three sources.


    PISA
    PISA is the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA measures 15-year-
    olds’ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life
    challenges. 78 education systems (70 countries and eight cities/autonomous regions) participated
    in the last round of PISA, which was carried out in 2018.

    For the purpose of this report, we use the survey data corresponding to countries with a sufficient
    sample of vocational track students in the EU. Because the survey measures skill proficiency of
    15-year-olds, it will not include vocational track students in countries where vocational studies
    only start at age 16 and later. The sample of countries used in our analysis thus includes these
    countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg,
    Portugal, Romania, and Slovenia.


    PIAAC
    The PIAAC is a survey that assesses the proficiency of adults in three information-processing
    skills essential for full participation in the knowledge-based economies and societies of the 21st
    century: literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments. The survey is run
    by the OECD. The target population for the survey consisted of the population aged 16–65 years,
    residing in the country at the time of data collection. Twenty-four countries participated in Round
    1 of the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC), with data collection taking place from 1 August 2011 to
    31 March 2012 in most countries. Nine countries participated in Round 2 of the assessment, with
    data collection taking place from April 2014 to end-March 2015. Six countries participated in
    Round 3, with data collection taking place from July to December 2017.

    For the analysis in this report, we use the survey data corresponding to 14 EU countries in Round 1
    (except where noted): Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece (Round 2), Hungary
    (Round 3), Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Slovak Republic, Slovenia (Round 2), and Spain.

    The survey identifies explicitly the adults with a vocational degree through the variable vet in the
    microdata. We use this variable to identify upper secondary (ISCED 3) and postsecondary (ISCED
    4) graduates with a vocational degree.




                                              APPENDIX B – DATA SOURCES AND DEFINITIONS FOR CHAPTER 4   101
         In terms of the variables used to measure skill proficiency, we focus on the plausible values of literacy
         pvlit1 and numeracy pvnum1. Our results are robust to the use of alternative plausible values.


         EU-LFS
         The EU-LFS is a quarterly labor force survey run in the 27 European Union countries and in other
         participating countries (Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, and
         Türkiye). It covers the resident population of working age (15 years and above) in each country,
         and it is aimed at assessing the employment status of the target population. The quarterly rounds
         of the survey include only a subset of the variables in the annual rounds of the survey, and for the
         analysis in this report, only the annual rounds are used.

         To classify individuals by educational group, the information recorded in three variables is used:
         •	 The variable “Highest educational attainment level” (HATLEV)
         •	 The variable “Orientation of the highest educational attainment level” (HATVOC)
         •	 The variable “Field of the highest educational attainment level” (HATFIELD)

         The variable HATLEV is asked to all the individuals aged 15 years and above. In the years 1998
         to 2013 this variable was recorded using the ISCED 97 classification, whereas in the years 2014
         and after the ISCED 11 classification was used. These two classifications, in the abridged versions
         used in the EU-LFS, distinguish upper-secondary students who follow tracks that provide access to
         tertiary education (codes 3A and 3B in ISCED 97; code 304 in ISCED 11) or that provide access only
         to nontertiary education (code 3C in ISCED 97; codes 302 and 303 in ISCED 11). Postsecondary
         nontertiary education is distinguished in two groups in ISCED 97 based on whether it provides access
         to tertiary education (codes 4A and 4B) or not (code 4C), but the version of ISCED 11 used in EU-LFS
         does not distinguish this (code 400 is used for all tracks of postsecondary nontertiary education).

         The variable HATVOC was included in EU-LFS starting from 2014, and it indicates whether the
         orientation of the highest attainment level is “general” or “vocational.” This variable is only recorded
         for individuals who report their higher attainment level being upper secondary (codes 300, 302,
         303, and 304 in ISCED 11) or postsecondary nontertiary (code 400 in ISCED 11) and it is only
         recorded for individuals who are 34 years or younger, or older than 34 years but have attained that
         level of education in the last five years.

         The variable HATFIELD was included in EU-LFS starting from 2003, and it indicates the field of the
         highest attainment level within a classification of 16 fields (for the survey rounds of years 2003
         to 2015) or a classification of 11 fields (for the survey rounds of year 2016 and later). This variable
         is only recorded for individuals who report their higher attainment level to be upper secondary or
         higher (ISCED 97 levels 3 and above, and ISCED 11 levels 300 and above). As HATVOC, this variable
         is only recorded for individuals 34 years or younger, or older than 34 years but have attained that
         level of education in the last five years.

         Critical to our report is the identification of vocational education graduates in the survey data.
         Strictly, the EU-LFS only allows to unambiguously identify vocational education graduates
         among the population age 15 to 34 in the years 2014 and later. To identify vocational education
         graduates of older age groups and in earlier years we follow two procedures. We start by following
         Vandeweyer and Verhagen (2020) to identify vocational education graduates between ages 15 to



102   THE FUTURE OF WORK: IMPLICATIONS FOR EQUITY AND GROWTH IN EUROPE
             34 in the period 2004–13. They find that, in the period after the variable HATVOC was included
             (2014 and after), an almost one-to-one match can be done between the variable HATVOC and
             HATFIELD—individuals that indicate that they pursued a vocational degree in HATVOC indicate a
             specific set of fields in the variable HATFIELD and vice versa.61 They use this match to attribute an
             imputed value of HATVOC for the period 2004–13 based on the values of HATFIELD reported for
             those years. We extend this procedure to other age groups, noting that, within the population age
             15–34, certain educational codes in the variable HATLEV in the period 2004–20 are associated
             unambiguously to a vocational degree. The assumption we use is that individuals older than 34
             who report these educational codes in HATLEV also hold a vocational degree. The combination
             of these two procedures lets us identify vocational education graduates among the population
             15 years and older in 17 countries in the period 2004–20 and in three countries in the period
             2014–20. Ambiguities remain in certain cases which do not let us completely identify the
             whole universe of vocational graduates, a portion of which may remain included in the “general
             secondary” category—particularly those graduates from a vocational track that allows access
             to tertiary education. Also, and following Vandeweyer and Verhagen (2020), in many cases we
             group upper-secondary vocational education graduates with postsecondary nontertiary vocational
             education graduate into a single group which we call “VET graduates.” The reason for this is that,
             due to the heterogeneity of VET systems in the EU, in some countries the students that pursue
             secondary studies in a vocational track graduate with a postsecondary degree, whereas in others
             they graduate with an upper-secondary degree.

             We note in Table B.1 the codes of the variable HATLEV that we use to identify VET graduates and
             in each country. For the case of Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, it
             is impossible to substantially identify vocational graduates of all age groups in any time period.62

61 Among   the possible fields in HATFIELD is “General programmes”/ “Generic programmes and qualifications” (code 000). In the case of individuals
 with upper secondary education with no access to tertiary education (code 304 in ISCED 11), 100 percent of respondents which indicated a
 field other than code 000 indicated that their degree was vocational in 21 countries. The same was true for individuals with upper secondary
 education with access to tertiary education (code 305 in ISCED 11) in 20 countries.
62 For Finland, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, it is only possible to identify them in the 15-34 age group.
