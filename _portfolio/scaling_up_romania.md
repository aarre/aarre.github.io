Romania has a variety of challenges and shortcomings in fostering innovation and
entrepreneurship. It ranks poorly across various indices related to innovation,
entrepreneurship, and digital entrepreneurship, indicating deficiencies in the
ecosystem supporting startups and high-growth firms. Key issues include low
investment in R&D, inadequate intellectual property protection, and limited
access to financing, especially for early-stage ventures. The country's
regulatory environment is cumbersome, hindering entrepreneurial activities.
Moreover, there is a disconnect in translating a high number of STEM graduates
into skilled R&D personnel within businesses. Recommendations focus on policy
reforms to enhance the functionality of support instruments, improve
regulations, attract talent through startup visas, and bolster entrepreneurial
education and digital economy initiatives. Significant financial investments are
proposed to address these gaps and stimulate a more robust entrepreneurial
ecosystem in Romania.
