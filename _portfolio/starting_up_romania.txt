EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Entrepreneurship flourishes in ecosystems. Once an entrepreneur identifies a business opportunity and is will-
ing to start a firm, she or he will also need the ability and knowledge to convert these promising ideas into goods
and services and sell them. To do so, the entrepreneur needs resources, such as infrastructure, physical capi-
tal, human capital, and knowledge. These resources are aspects of the entrepreneurship ecosystem. Successful
entrepreneurs must be able to access the resources they need, including by reallocating them from less suc-
cessful competitors. Factors that influence their ability to do so—access to capital, regulations, and social capi-
tal—are also aspects of the ecosystem. In addition, entrepreneurs must also have talent, be surrounded by other
highly capable firms, and have access to markets for their goods or services. An entrepreneurship ecosystem is
the sum of these complementary factors available through institutions and individuals within a geographic area.

To deliver more effective policies supporting innovative startups, understanding the complementary factors in en-
trepreneurship ecosystems is key. The quality of an ecosystem determines entrepreneurship performance and the
likelihood of creating economically impactful businesses. In most emerging countries, essential elements of institu-
tions, networks and actors that enable entrepreneurship and innovation are missing, underdeveloped, or malfunction-
ing. The multiplicity of problems to be addressed and limited financial and human capacity make it difficult to design
and implement policies that support entrepreneurship and innovation. Thus, having clarity on the challenges sur-
rounding entrepreneurs, both nationally and locally, is essential for identifying priorities and defining a policy strategy.

This report outlines three essential elements to inform a comprehensive strategy in support of entrepre-
neurship in Romania. First, it offers a big picture of entrepreneurship performance and ecosystem pillars at the
national level, benchmarked against Romania’s peers. It will identify structural obstacles faced by entrepreneurs in
order to define the key strategic objectives. Second, the report provides new evidence about startups in Romania.
The findings highlight the importance of understanding the types of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship activ-
ity in the national ecosystem, as well as the diversity of local ecosystems, to help refine the focus of policy. Third,
it assesses the existing policy mix and ecosystem enablers supporting entrepreneurship. It is important to know
what resources and policy instruments already support entrepreneurship, either via public programs or ecosystem
enablers, that may also allocate public resources. Understanding the policy mix is particularly relevant for emerg-
ing and more advanced economies, that may have an array of institutions and instruments already in place and
where there may be a greater need to optimize allocations.

The analysis draws on numerous data sources, including important new evidence from organizations sup-
porting entrepreneurship and a nationally representative survey focused on tech startups. First, it combines
several datasets, including the World Bank’s Entrepreneurship database and Enterprise Surveys, to conduct an
aggregated analysis with cross-country comparison. Second, it analyzes Romanian firms in the Romanian Business
Registry, Lista Firme, PitchBook, and CrunchBase databases to analyze the geographic distribution and connect-
edness of startups. These data are also used as a sampling frame to build a new representative survey to com-
pare average tech startups with high-potential startups. The analysis also aims to uncover regional variances in
Romanian firms and ecosystems to surface data-driven policy recommendations. Third, the analysis reviews pro-
grams, policies, and institutions—both public sector initiatives and private ecosystem enablers—that support entre-
preneurship to analyze the policy mix and the functionality of these programs.

The report is organized in four chapters that together provide a comprehensive assessment of entrepreneur-
ship and startup performance in Romania. Chapter 1 examines the context of entrepreneurship in Romania
through a cross-country comparison that covers key outcomes and structural pillars of the ecosystem. The analy-
sis exploits both firm-level data and cross-country indicators. Chapter 2 spotlights the potential of subnational en-
trepreneurship ecosystems, with a focus on tech startups and high-potential startups. This chapter identifies po-
tential subnational ecosystems and sheds light on the characteristics of average tech startups in Romania—and
their similarities to and differences from high-potential startups from Romania. It also includes a connectedness
analysis, which helps us understand the relationships between entities in the ecosystem and the regional inter-
dependencies. Chapter 3 examines the characteristics of public programs and private ecosystem enablers sup-
porting entrepreneurship in Romania. Chapter 4 presents the policy recommendations stemming from the analy-
sis within the report and juxtaposes them with policy priorities identified by ecosystem stakeholders.
Executive Summary                                                                                                10




The analysis supports three key messages for entrepreneurship policy strategies in Romania: (1) there is a
lack of high-growth and innovative entrepreneurship, many firms are necessity driven, (2) human capital is
not being used optimally, and (3) the government needs to improve the policy mix for innovation, entrepre-
neurship, and digitalization and its institutional capabilities to implement these programs. First, entrepre-
neurship in Romania is characterized by high entry rates and low levels of scaling up and innovation compared to
regional and global peers. Even among digital and tech startups, which is a sector of the economy that is known
for being innovative and eager for high growth, there is a large share of firms whose founders lack the appropriate
academic background, business experience, and international exposure. Most of these young firms are not inno-
vating, nor do they have ambitions to significantly scale up to external markets in the next five years, or through
acquisitions and IPOs in the long term. Thus, Romania’s policy strategy should focus on improving the quality,
rather than the quantity, of entrepreneurship. Second, Romania has a high flow of human capital from the educa-
tional system that is neither being absorbed by the private sector nor being attracted to entrepreneurship activ-
ity. Despite Romania’s high share of science and engineering graduates, firms have limited use of research and
development (R&D) personnel, low usage of digital technologies, and low levels of collaboration with public sector
and academia. The supply of human and knowledge capital is disproportionally concentrated in Bucharest. Third,
Romania needs to improve the policy mix and institutional capabilities. There are important gaps in support for
entrepreneurs and early-stage startups and few instruments focus on the private sector. Additionally, many instru-
ments lack robust evaluation mechanisms.

The report proposes a set of policy interventions, areas for experiments, and further studies that are needed
to continue refining an evidence-based strategy supporting impactful entrepreneurship. In addition to the key
messages, the analysis on public programs and ecosystem enablers also shows that there is significant room to
improve existing programs supporting entrepreneurs and innovative businesses. Thus, the recommendations focus
on three key areas: (i) improving the institutional capabilities and optimizing public resources supporting business
programs, (ii) improving the regulatory environment and facilitating access to finance for innovative entrepreneurs,
and (iii) attracting more qualified entrepreneurs and building entrepreneurship capacity.

                                 OVERVIEW


Entrepreneurship plays a critical role in economic growth and creating more and better jobs. In most countries,
many jobs created by micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are concentrated in a small share of young firms
that grow quickly in brief spurts. These impactful businesses operate in many sectors and tend to be more innovative,
more connected to global value chains, and more likely to benefit from economies of agglomeration than other firms.
Such high-potential startups are difficult to identify ex ante. Nevertheless, they are more likely to arise in dynamic eco-
systems with complementary factors providing the conditions for: (i) high entry rates of (better-quality) firms, (ii) ca-
pacity of those firms to scale up, and (iii) the likelihood that they will promote innovation and technological upgrading.

To deliver more effective policies supporting innovative startups, it is essential to understand the comple-
mentary factors in entrepreneurship ecosystems. This report follows a methodology developed by the World
Bank (2022) to assess entrepreneurship ecosystems. From the moment an entrepreneur sees an opportunity and
decides to start a business, she or he requires the ability and knowledge to convert (new) ideas into (new) goods
and services and market (sell) them. To do so, the entrepreneur needs resources (physical capital and infrastruc-
ture, human capital, and knowledge) that will be combined in the production process and sold as final goods or
services. Successful entrepreneurs must be able to allocate the resources they need, which requires a functional
financial system and institutional environment. The analysis takes into consideration these complementary fac-
tors linked to the performance of entrepreneurship at national and subnational levels (figure O.1).

Overview                                                                                                                                        13




An entrepreneurship ecosystem is the sum of complementary factors within a geographic area (such as a city,
region, or country) that are needed to start a business that can scale up and innovate. Strong entrepreneur-
ship ecosystems rest on three pillars (figure O.1). That is, they require (1) a sufficient supply of resources (physi-
cal, human, and knowledge capital), (2) a suitable set of demand factors (access to markets, firm capabilities, and
entrepreneurial characteristics), (3) and an efficient set of allocation factors (access to finance, regulations, and
social capital) that facilitate the optimal accumulation of resources to the most productive firms. In a functional
ecosystem, entrepreneurs with potentially profitable projects and the capacity to execute them are more likely to
find the resources they need, have access to markets for their products and services, interact with other firms
with good capabilities, and face few barriers in terms of using resources (for example, better access to finance,
regulatory environment, and a business-friendly culture). Three outcomes are likely to occur in such an ecosys-
tem. One, more new firms will enter the market. Two, existing firms will grow. And three, innovation will accelerate.

In most countries, essential elements of institutions, networks and actors that enable entrepreneurship and
innovation are missing, underdeveloped, or malfunctioning. The multiplicity of problems to be addressed and
constraints on financial and human capacity make it difficult to design and implement policies that support entre-
preneurship and innovation. In this context, figure O.1 provides a framework used across the chapters of this report
to identify priority areas and reduce these multidimensional problems.

Policy makers can maximize economic growth—and high-quality job creation—by addressing market failures in the
entrepreneurship ecosystem. The combination of supply, demand, and allocative factors within a healthy ecosystem results
in the creation of high-paying jobs, increased exports, innovation, and productivity growth. Under this conceptual framework,
entrepreneurship outputs are assessed in terms of firm dynamics—entry, growth (scaling up) and innovation (upgrading).
Longer-term entrepreneurship outcomes are measured in terms of productivity and jobs, and potentially in terms of reve-
nues, exports, and economic growth. Market failures may arise in any of the factors of the entrepreneurship ecosystem1
in the supply, demand, or allocation pillars. Governments can influence an ecosystem directly through policy instruments
and regulations or indirectly through ecosystem enablers that support entrepreneurship (bottom of figure O.1 in navy).

This report focuses on startups and entrepreneurship with the potential for growth and innovation. Table O.1
provides some examples of the heterogeneity of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs. Three common variables
used by policy makers for discussing or targeting interventions aiming to boost entrepreneurship are age (such as
startups), sector, and size (such as microenterprises and small and medium enterprises [SMEs])—including chang-
es in size over time (such as high-growth firms). These are not exclusive categories. Very often, the term startup is
used to refer to a special subsample of new and young firms, looking to scale up quickly by intensively using digital
technologies or new business models. This report refers to these firms as tech startups. Among startups, those that
have garnered international attention in the private equity market, the report refers to as high-potential startups.

This report is organized in four chapters that provide a comprehensive assessment of the entrepreneurship
ecosystems in Romania. The analysis draws on numerous data sources, including new evidence from organiza-
tions supporting entrepreneurship and a nationally representative survey focused on tech startups. Chapter 1 of
the report provides a big picture of entrepreneurship performance and the health of the ecosystem pillars at the
national level that is benchmarked against Romania’s peers. This information is important to define the key strat-
egy objectives and structural obstacles faced by entrepreneurs in general. In chapter 2, the report provides new
evidence about startups in Romania. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the type of entre-
preneurs and entrepreneurship activity, as well as the diversity of local ecosystems to define the focus of the pol-
icy. In chapter 3, the report assesses the policy mix and functioning of public resources and enabling institutions
supporting entrepreneurship. It is critical to know what resources and policy instruments are already available
to support entrepreneurship, either by public programs or by entrepreneurship enablers, which may also allo-
cate public resources. This is particularly relevant for emerging and more advanced economies, with an array of
institutions and instruments already in place and more potential to improve allocation. Chapter 4 provides pol-
icy recommendations.




OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 1.  THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP ECOSYSTEM
IN ROMANIA


    KEY QUESTIONS
    Chapter 1 examines the context of entrepreneurship in Romania through a cross-country compari-
    son, following a conceptual framework that covers key outputs and structural pillars of the ecosystem.
    These pillars are the supply factors, the demand factors, and the barriers to the flow of resources that are
    critical for generating more and better firms. The analysis exploits both firm-level data and cross-coun-
    try indicators.

    Chapter 1 aims to address the following questions through a cross-country comparison:

    •	How are entrepreneurship outputs performing in Romania, both in terms of quantity (number of new
      firms entering) and quality (number of firms scaling up and innovating)?

    •	What are the conditions of the entrepreneurship supply factors in Romania (that is, the infrastructure,
      human capital, and knowledge available for entrepreneurs)?
    •	What are the conditions of the entrepreneurship demand factors in Romania (that is, access to mar-
      kets, capabilities of existent firms, and entrepreneurs entering the market)?

    •	What are the key barriers in Romania to allocation of resources towards higher quality entrepreneur-
      ship, with respect to access to finance, the regulatory environment, and culture?


The share of high-quality firms, i.e., those achieving high growth and innovating, is smaller in Romania than
in peer countries. The entry rate of new firms in Romania is not the main constraint on entrepreneurship. As
compared to other countries with similar per capita income, Romania has a high entry rate. However, there are
few high-growth firms. The share of high-growth firms2 in Romania has been stable, hovering around 3 percent
between 2016 and 2018 (figure O.2). This share is well below that in peer countries, which averages 11.4 per-
cent. Low shares of high-growth firms are also observed in specific sectors (for example, manufacturing) and
young firms, given that Romania also has few young high-growth firms (5 years or younger). Chapter 1 shows that
there is a similar trend among firms that innovate. Only a small share of firms in Romania reports any type of

annum, over a three-year period, and with ten or more employees at the beginning of the observation period” where growth can be measured in
number of employees or in turnover (OECD-Eurostat 2007; OECD 2010).

  firm but is also observed across firm size groups; among large, medium, and small firms.

  Firm entry is driven by necessity rather than by opportunity. Among several potential explanations for the lack of
  high growth and innovation among Romanian firms, there is the fact that many entrepreneurs are “necessity” rather
  than “opportunity” entrepreneurs. Three in ten businesses were created because the entrepreneurs did not have
  any other opportunities in the labor market. The share of entrepreneurs pushed by necessity has been higher than
  the European Union (EU) average across different demo-
  graphic groups (figure O.3). Thus, to improve entrepre-
  neurship performance, Romania needs to improve the FIGURE O.3  Entrepreneurship by Necessity

Entrepreneurship can drive demand for knowledge that would improve the collaboration between research
institutions and businesses in Romania. Collaboration on R&D and business innovation is low. Romanian uni-
versities have not developed strong linkages with the business sector, and the level of collaboration between inno-
vative firms and other organizations is low. Such linkages matter not only for ensuring the translation of research
and new ideas into real-world innovations but also for ensuring the relevance of university teaching and research.
Knowledge-exchange activities are now legally allowed as part of a higher education institution’s mission, but
Romanian companies may not be proactively establishing linkages with universities given the low levels of R&D
and limited technological specialization and knowledge intensity.

Improvement in entrepreneurship quality will also require more market opportunities for young and small busi-
nesses, both domestically and abroad. Barriers are preventing smaller firms from participating in public procurement.
Public sector can create an important market for many startups and play a role in stimulating innovation. While recent
reforms have improved awareness, current public procurement processes and platforms are still perceived as difficult
to access for startups and other small firms. According to the most recent data available (2019), SMEs bid on 35 per-
cent of public procurement contracts but are awarded only 5 percent of them. Regarding access to external markets,
Romania has fewer exporters than peer countries and uses a smaller proportion of imports in its exports. Only 17 per-
cent of Romanian firms export more than 1 percent of their sales (compared to 29 percent of Slovakian firms). The
use of e-commerce remains low, but uptake of e-commerce platforms has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandem-
ic. Romania saw the share of firms selling online rise to 19 percent in 2020 from 9 percent in 2018. However, there re-
mains vast unrealized potential: less than 20 percent of firms received even 1 percent of their revenue via online sales.

Access to finance for startups and innovative firms remains a challenge. Romanian public sector financing
mechanisms are not tailored for small firms and startups because they tend to favor post-revenue firms, which
may have the effect of supporting incumbents over new entrants. Moreover, equity and debt financing for research
and development remain below the EU average (European Commission 2017).

Romania’s regulatory environment is not optimized for entrepreneurs and startups. This includes reforms to
Romania’s company formation process, supporting distressed businesses, improving the ease of exiting a busi-
ness, investing into startups, and intellectual property (IP) protections. This is because policymakers do not clearly
distinguish between startups and SMEs and thus the former remain underserved by the existing regulatory envi-
ronment (and policy mix).

Though entrepreneurship is accorded reasonably high social status, increasingly considered a desirable career
choice, and widely promoted by the media, Romania ranks low on indicators of social capital. Low social capital,

which has been observed by the EU (European Commission 2017), is also evident in the ecosystem where stake-
holders reported siloed networks and limited collaboration and connectedness between stakeholders, reinforcing
the perception of ecosystem fragmentation. There also appears to be a limited “give back” mentality in Romania.




OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 2.  STARTUPS AND LOCAL
ENTREPRENEURSHIP ECOSYSTEMS


    KEY QUESTIONS
    Chapter 2 analyzes the subnational landscape of businesses and assesses the potential of Romania’s
    local entrepreneurship ecosystems with a focus on tech startups. First, it provides an overall perspec-
    tive on the distribution of firms and entrepreneurship performance at the subnational level. Second, the
    chapter identifies the potential of local entrepreneurship ecosystems through agglomerations of firms in
    technology-intensive sectors in terms of the quality of the firms and the diversity of their economic activ-
    ities. Third, it analyzes the results of the World Bank Group Romania Startup Survey—a new nationally
    representative dataset collected for this report. Finally, the chapter uses network analysis to identify the
    connectedness of key actors of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Romania.

    Chapter 2 aims to address the following questions:

    •	How is economic activity distributed regionally within Romania?

    •	Where are the more technology-intensive regional ecosystems in Romania?

    •	What are the key characteristics of tech startups in Romania?

    •	What are the key obstacles reported by tech startups in Romania?

    •	How does connectedness play out among Romania’s ecosystems?



When it comes to economic activity, the geographic distribution of firms and sectoral specialization in Romania
reflects significant regional disparity in human and knowledge capital. There is a large concentration of firms
in the Bucharest-Ilfov region. Bucharest-Ilfov also has the highest rate of new firms entering the market, the high-
est share of young firms, the highest share of high-growth firms, the most educated workforce, the highest con-
centration of capital working on science and technology, and the most R&D personnel and researchers. The dis-
parity between the regional distribution of firms in the country can also be observed through the concentration of
human capital by sector in each region. Digital and knowledge-intensive activities, in services, as well high-tech
manufacturing enterprises, in industry, are disproportionally concentrated in Bucharest-Ilfov.

More technology-intensive regional ecosystems are agglomerated around a few large metropolitan areas. (See
figure O.6.) Digital services firms are defined as those providing mostly digital content.3 Examples of digital services
are transactional technologies that facilitate market transactions by lowering information asymmetries (such as
e-commerce platforms or blockchain), informational technologies that exploit the exponential growth of data and
or reduce the cost of computing (such as cloud computing, big data analytics, or machine learning), and opera-
tional technologies that combine data with physical automation (such as smart robots, 3D printing, or the Internet
of Things) (Hallward-Driemeier et al. 2020). Knowledge-intensive services enterprises (Miles et al. 1995) are those
whose employment structures are heavily weighted towards professional and technical expertise. Examples of
these firms are engineering services, research and experimental development, and specialized health services.

Most tech startups do not consider themselves innovative. Among tech startups, 67.5 percent did not consider
themselves innovative. Some 21.4 percent reported developing an innovation, and only 12.5 percent expected
to do it in the future. Less than 20 percent were developing new-to-market technologies or processes for national
or international markets (figure O.7). Most of the firms that are innovating are providing innovative products or
technologies; some are also innovating in terms of the business models (figure O.8). Twenty-six percent of these
firms had applied for a patent, copyright or trademark, and 39 percent of firms are planning to do so. This could
potentially be an indicator of limited knowledge creation and innovation, or of limited awareness of the IP systems.

High-potential startups rely more on venture capital (VC). Personal savings or resources are the main source of
funding for the initial development stages of both tech startups and high-potential startups, although some high-po-
tential startups have angel investment or VC. High-potential startups typically expected to use VC for subsequent
growth. Among tech startups, most of the funding after the initial stage was expected to continue to come from per-
sonal resources. In contrast, among high-potential startups, most of the funding after the initial stage was expected
to come from angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs) and, to a smaller degree, from personal resources.

The two biggest obstacles for entrepreneurship reported by startups were business regulations and the lack
of an entrepreneurial mindset. (See figure O.9.) Regulations, which were identified as an issue in every Romanian
region, included labor regulations and administrative issues such as permits and taxes. In addition, respondents
identified that the lack of collaboration among actors could also be an obstacle, which means that entrepreneurship

as well as infrastructure quality and managerial capabilities—as generally favorable.

The data on connectedness reinforces the importance of the Bucharest-Ilfov ecosystem for knowledge con-
nections among Romanian ecosystems. Including a geographic dimension in the network (by geo-localizing all
the entities) shows that the most predominant connections are between Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara, and
Constanta (figure O.10). These local ecosystems rely on each other, mostly in terms of human and social capital
and finance. However, most of the local startups relate to Bucharest’s universities, accelerators, and funders. The
data also show that firms rely little on their local ecosystems, except for Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca. Therefore,
improving the Bucharest ecosystem could generate important externalities to other local ecosystems in the coun-
try, regardless of their economic activity. Additionally, more attention to all other regions is needed to strengthen
ecosystem support structures across Romania.

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 3.  SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
PROGRAMS


    KEY QUESTIONS
    Chapter 3 assesses the support for entrepreneurship and innovation in Romania. The first part of the
    chapter focuses on public programs supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. It examines the offer of
    50 public programs, the resources allocated to them, and the consistency of this policy mix with policy pri-
    orities. The functional analysis assesses how well these public programs are managed across 27 dimen-
    sions associated with best practices in design, implementation, and governance. The second part of the
    chapter focuses on mapping and describing the services and resources provided by ecosystem enablers,
    that is, non-government institutions supporting entrepreneurship and startups in Romania.
    This chapter aims to address the following questions:
    •	What is the current policy mix of public programs for entrepreneurship and innovation?
    •	Are the public programs targeting innovative and high-growth entrepreneurship in Romania?
    •	Are the public programs following best practices in design, implementation, and governance?
    •	Who oversees public programs for entrepreneurship and innovation?
    •	What are the characteristics of entrepreneurship ecosystem enablers in Romania, and how are they
      allocating resources to support entrepreneurship?



The total budget allocation for programs supporting science, technology, and innovation is over €3.6 billion,
with almost €1 billion focusing on entrepreneurship but only a little over one-quarter of the policy mix has
entrepreneurship as its core objective. The mapping exercise (Figure O.11),4 which was conducted in collaboration

4. The initial stage of the review was to compile a list of relevant programs involving public resources; this list explicitly included subnational
(regional), national, and supra-national (European Commission) programs, provided that the program was at least partially administered within
Romania and the recipients themselves were in Romania. The mapping exercise did not include the programs of the European Investment Fund
(EIF) because the relevant program information was not available. This is also due to the fact that some of the programs were managed by third
parties, making it difficult to understand how much of the funding was dedicated towards which objectives and target beneficiaries. However,
according to the EIF website, since 2008, the EIF has committed over €2 billion, composed of €1.8 billion in guarantees and funded instru-
ments, €206 million in equity, and €123 million in microfinance and social entrepreneurship. The instruments of the EIF typically also target
ecosystem enablers such as incubators and accelerators, which are usually not targeted by national public support programs.

with government agencies, identified 50 public programs supporting science, technology, and innovation (STI) and
entrepreneurship during 2014–20. This section examines the overall portfolio of 50 programs, including their
estimated budget allocations, objectives, types of intervention, and beneficiaries. The analysis also assesses the
functionality and governance of selected Romanian STI support programs (the “functional analysis”).

Thirteen of the 50 instruments, with a related total budget allocation of €949 million, have entrepreneurship
as an explicit goal. The remaining three-quarters of the policy mix relates primarily to innovation & competitive-
ness, R&D, or digitization. These areas, however, may be considered indirectly relevant to entrepreneurship or the
development of the broader ecosystem.

Romania can use internal learning to increase the effectiveness of its innovation policies. Across 27 indica-
tors spanning design, implementation, and governance, Romanian public entrepreneurship programs only consist-
ently used best practice on two indicators—program origin and project closures. However, some programs scored
higher than others on the same indicators, indicating opportunities for learning within Romania. Figure O.12
shows the maximum and minimum scores for each indicator in addition to the average score for each indicator.
The maximum scores are coded in green, the average scores are coded in yellow, and the minimum lower scores
are coded in red. Some indicators have relatively high scores in at least one instrument, even when the average is
quite low. This indicates that instruments that are not currently using best practices can learn from those that are.

Overview                                                                                                          22




There are several indicators that seem to need systematic improvement. These indicators are design indicators
associated with the use of logic models, inputs and activities of the instrument rather than supported projects,
and the matter of setting instrument objectives and definition of specific outcomes and impacts. There is also an
implementation indicator in this group, namely, the budget, that seems also to be a systemic issue.

Program design was the weakest of the three key areas of the assessment framework. Among the design cat-
egories, the use of logic models, accounting for inputs and activities, and the proper identification and measure-
ment of outcomes were particularly lacking.

In contrast, the program origins and closures were one of the highest-scoring features of the analysis. This is
explained by the fact that many of the examined entrepreneurship programs were partly funded by the European
Commission, whose operating programs are highly formalized, requiring documentation and good rationales for
inclusion of programs in their funding schemes. This avoids pitfalls related to arbitrary reasoning, imitation, or
undue influence in the creation of new programs. However, it is possible that this formalized origin also affected
deeper consideration of some other design features: more than once, interviewees commented that a program
had been designed in a certain way because of the expectations of the co-funder (the European Commission),
rather than because it was the most effective or efficient way to deliver the desired change.

The analysis found that program implementation and governance scored slightly better than design, although
there was scope for major improvement in most categories. Among the implementation categories, the areas
of greatest concern are (1) application and selection processes, (2) management structures, (3) budgets, (4) the
incentives associated with staff performance, and (5) evaluation mechanisms.

The analysis found relatively good internal and external coordination mechanisms (coordination with programs
within the agency and with other agencies). This is partly because programs within the European Commission’s
“priority axes” have some coordination mechanisms built in. However, in some cases those mechanisms could be
utilized further to provide more strategic perspectives on the related programs. 

The analysis also found that Romania lacks a central institution to oversee the implementation of public in-
struments for entrepreneurship. Many instruments were structured in a way that involved both a managing au-
thority (MA) and an intermediary body (IB) working in coordination. Additionally, disbursements for these programs,
as measured by absorption rates, are weak, indicating lack of suitable institutional capacity. Data from October
2020 indicates that the absorption rate was only 34.7 percent for programs administered by the Human Capital
Program (Programul Operațional Capital Uman, POCU), 31.8 percent for the Regional Operational Programme
(Programul Operațional Regional, POR), and as low as 26.5 percent for the Competitiveness Operational Programme
(Programul Operațional Competitivitate, POC).

The mapping also identified a total of 33 enablers supporting entrepreneurship. Twenty-seven of them partic-
ipated in the World Bank Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Enablers survey, which is used as the main reference for
this analysis.5 The services offered by these enablers are meant to complement those offered by public programs.
However, given the diversity of the programs offered—in terms of their scope, objectives, geographical coverage,
and types of beneficiaries—the enablers and the services they provide overlap with public programs or each other,
resulting in coordination challenges.

The most typical ecosystem enablers in the sample are private for-profit community builders or event organiz-
ers. The most common functions of enablers were as community builders or event organizers (14 organizations),
investors or financial institutions (7 organizations), and accelerators (5). Most were private for-profit (20 organi-
zations) and nongovernmental organization non-profit (10 organizations). The Romanian state role (public-private
partnerships) was very limited. International organizations were not identified.

The top three services provided by ecosystem enablers were strengthening and building collaboration net-
works, management and business training, and access to finance. The availability of assistance with building

and strengthening collaboration networks underscores the importance of network density within the startup eco-
systems and reflects comments reported in primary research interviews about the need for better ecosystem-wide
connections. The next most frequent core service was management and business training; this category may also
include mentoring support, which is a common feature of many accelerators. However, if one considers both core
and complementary offers, then market access was delivered more frequently. Access to finance was the third
most common core service. About 19 enablers provided services related to strengthening and building collabo-
ration networks, 14 enablers provided managerial and business training for new entrepreneurs starting a new
business (for example, change of mindset), and 12 provided finance. This is consistent with the fact that the func-
tion of most of the organizations in the sample is holding events to build communities, followed by investing and
accelerating new ventures. As complementary services, they provide business training for existing firms, support
to comply with current regulations and, to a lesser extent, support for technology adoption. Most do not provide
financial support (19 enablers), and equity finance and grants play a small role. Most enablers did not expect
beneficiaries to pay for the non-financial services that they provide.

Most ecosystem enablers reported following key performance indicators (KPIs) regularly, but only a few of
them conduct rigorous impact evaluation to inform programming. About a third (9) of the enablers support-
ing entrepreneurial activities performed quarterly performance reviews, 8 conducted annual reviews, and 7 con-
ducted monthly reviews. The vast majority reviewed
KPIs at a higher frequency. Firm scale-up and firm
creation are the top KPIs,, with well over half of ena- FIGURE O.13  Impact Evaluations Conducted by

Follow-up funding was another popular indicator, and
some enablers used other indicators. However, only

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 4.  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS


   KEY QUESTIONS
   Chapter 4 provides policy recommendations informed by the results of the analytical work presented
   in this report and consultations with key actors of the entrepreneurship ecosystems in Romania. In brief,
   more funding needs to be allocated to improve quality and scale-up of firms, as well as promote net-
   working and deepening linkages with successful founders, including diaspora entrepreneurs. The chap-
   ter provides evidence-driven and stakeholder-driven policy recommendations aligned with the pillars of
   the ecosystem. It also compares our policy recommendations with the Top 12 policy interventions pro-
   posed by the Romanian ecosystem.

   An overview of each policy recommendation is provided in this report. Detailed policy recommendations

   This chapter aims to address the following questions:

   •	Is this mix of public programs and ecosystem enablers conducive to supporting quality entrepreneurship?
   •	What are the main gaps in support for the Romanian entrepreneurship ecosystem identified through
     the diagnostic report?

   •	What are the prioritized policy recommendations to support entrepreneurship based on the key find-
     ings of this report and ecosystem stakeholders?


The essential recommendations have to do with better targeting the policy mix and improving the functional-
ity of public programs supporting entrepreneurship. Romania could improve entrepreneurship quality by rebal-
ancing its policy mix to target high-potential startups with ambitions of scaling up. For the rebalancing to be effec-
tive, Romania would, in conjunction, need to improve the functioning of public entrepreneurship support programs,
which can be facilitated by building capacity among implementing agencies.

These policy recommendations and prioritization were derived from two mutually reinforcing activities: the
diagnostic of Romanian’s entrepreneurship ecosystem and strategy working group sessions with key actors
of the Romanian entrepreneurship ecosystem. This diagnostic surfaced 11 evidence-based policy recommen-
dations, and the Romanian ecosystem identified their “Top 12” interventions. Our analysis and the bottom-up
strategy development process identified a number of similar policies, programs, and institutions. There are two
main differences. First, based on an analysis of public instruments supporting STI and entrepreneurship, the evi-
dence-based analysis identified an urgent need to recalibrate the policy mix and improve its functionality. Second,
the Romanian ecosystem identified a need to appoint Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) in government. Although
we concur with this recommendation, the authorities need to prioritize other critical interventions.

The overall objectives of the policy recommendations are to refocus attention on starting and scaling high-qual-
ity firms and improve the governance and functionality of existing instruments. The recommendations are cat-
egorized as policies, programs, or institutions. Policies refer to legislative or regulatory reforms to create an ena-
bling environment for high-growth entrepreneurship to take root and thrive. Programs refer to programs that target
entrepreneurs, firms, and other ecosystem actors. Institutions refer to governance and entities essential for the
entrepreneurship agenda. The 11 policy recommendations are as follows:

Policies

  1.	Recalibrate the policy mix for starting and scaling high quality innovative firms by (a) Improving the function-
     ality of instruments, and (b) Implementing a comprehensive package of reforms tailored to high quality inno-
     vative firms (i.e., the National Startup Ecosystem Strategy).

  2.	Reform regulations to strengthen entrepreneurship and investments refers to initiatives that ease starting
     and exiting a business; incentivizes appropriate sources of financing into startups; promotes public procure-
     ment; and addresses IP protections.

  3.	Implement Startup Visas refers to immigration incentives to attract skilled talent and investors.



Programs

  4.	Strengthen ecosystem enablers refers to a pilot program to build capacity and deepen networks and link-
     ages of Romanian ecosystem actors.

  5.	Create a Startup Fund refers to establishing a fund that directly invests into riskier stage firms.

  6.	Build and promote a network of Romanian founders and diaspora refers to leveraging exposure and exper-
     tise of successful founders and diaspora to advise on critical issues such as market access and resources.

  7.	Scale-up through exports refers to initiatives to help Romanian startups access international markets.


Institutions

  8.	Establish a One-Stop Agency or “Ecosystem Hub” refers to the formation of a centralized institution to imple-
     ment programs and policies identified under the National Startup Ecosystem Strategy and the Startup Fund.



Policies, Programs, and Institutions

  9.	Improve entrepreneurship education and strengthen the role of universities in the ecosystem refers to human
     capital related measures to improve the quality of Romanian startups.

10.	Incentivize innovation to foster knowledge spillovers into the private sector refers to ensuring startups and
    firms can benefit from R&D infrastructure.

11.	Promote the Digital Economy identifies three subcomponents for consideration by Romanian policymakers.
    They are (i) promoting e-commerce platforms; (ii) increasing digital skills; and (iii) improving managerial capa-
    bilities to enable technology adoption.

These recommendations are also prioritized in several ways. (See table O.2.) “Quick wins” are actions that
are visible, have immediate benefit, and can be delivered quickly. “Mission critical” refers to activities that (i) are
extremely time sensitive because the government is currently designing the new programming period, which pro-
vides an opportunity to embed data-driven and specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)
policy recommendations; or (ii) lay the groundwork for future recommendations. If these recommendations are
not immediately prioritized, Romanian authorities risk missing its economic objectives. “Flagship” refers to critical
activities that should be undertaken to further development of Romania’s emerging entrepreneurship ecosystem.
“Foundational long-term” refers to critical activities that require a longer time horizon to come to fruition because
there are other “foundational” elements that need to be sequenced and prioritized first.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
ECOSYSTEM IN ROMANIA:
A CROSS-COUNTRY
ANALYSIS
   Chapter 1  Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Romania: A Cross-Country Analysis                                                                     28




       KEY QUESTIONS
       Chapter 1 examines the context of entrepreneurship in Romania through a cross-country compari-
       son, following a conceptual framework that covers key outputs and structural pillars of the ecosystem.
       These pillars are the supply factors, the demand factors, and the barriers to the flow of resources that are
       critical for generating more and better firms. The analysis exploits both firm-level data and cross-coun-
       try indicators.

       This chapter aims to address the following questions through a cross-country comparison:

       •	How are entrepreneurship outputs performing in Romania, both in terms of quantity (number of new
         firms entering) and quality (number of firms scaling up and innovating)?

       •	What are the conditions of the entrepreneurship supply factors in Romania (that is, the infrastructure,
         human capital, and knowledge available for entrepreneurs)?

       •	What are the conditions of the entrepreneurship demand factors in Romania (that is, access to mar-
         kets, capabilities of existent firms, and entrepreneurs entering the market)?
       •	What are the key barriers in Romania to allocation of resources towards higher quality entrepreneur-
         ship, with respect to access to finance, the regulatory environment, and culture?




	1.1	 CONCEPTUAL                            FRAMEWORK
   An entrepreneurship ecosystem is the sum of complementary factors within a geographic area (e.g., city or
   country) that are needed for an entrepreneur starting a business able to scale up and innovate. Strong entrepre-
   neurship ecosystems rest on three pillars (figure 1.1). That is, they require a sufficient supply of resources (phys-
   ical, human, and knowledge capital), a suitable set of demand factors (access to markets, firm capabilities, and
   entrepreneurial characteristics), and an efficient set of allocation factors (access to finance, regulations, and
   social capital) that facilitate the optimal accumulation of resources to the most productive firms. In a functional
   ecosystem, three outcomes are likely to occur: One, more new firms will enter the market. Two, existing firms will
   grow. And three, innovation will accelerate. When these three things happen, it is likely that productivity and job
   growth will also accelerate. These increases in productivity and job growth are the ultimate desirable outcomes
   of entrepreneurship.

   This chapter follows the conceptual framework depicted in figure 1.1 to analyze the entrepreneurship eco-
   system in Romania at the country level. It does so by comparing Romania with peer countries with respect to
   entrepreneurship performance (entry, scale up, and innovation) and the entrepreneurship ecosystem pillars. This
   analysis is complemented in chapter 2 with a deep dive into the subnational entrepreneurial landscape with focus
   on technology startups.

   Policy makers can influence the entrepreneurship ecosystem to maximize economic growth, and subsequent
   high-quality job creation, by addressing market failures. The combination of supply, demand, and allocative
   factors within a healthy ecosystem results in the creation of high-paying jobs, increased exports, innovation, and
   productivity growth. Under this conceptual framework, entrepreneurship outputs are assessed in terms of firm
   dynamics—entry, growth (scaling up) and innovation (upgrading). Longer-term entrepreneurship outcomes are
   measured in terms of productivity and jobs, and potentially in terms of revenues, exports, and economic growth.
   Market failures may arise in any of the factors of the entrepreneurship ecosystem: the supply, demand, or allo-
   cation pillars.6 Governments can influence an ecosystem directly through policy instruments and regulations or


   6. Some of these failures can be government failures or inefficiencies created by interventions of the government itself (for example, distortive
   regulations).

    indirectly through ecosystem enablers that support entrepreneurship, which can affect any of those pillars (bot-
    tom of figure 1.1 in navy). The assessment of the public programs and the non-government intermediary organ-
    izations supporting entrepreneurs is presented in chapter 3, followed by policy recommendations in chapter 4.

	1.2	THE                             UNIVERSE OF FIRMS IN ROMANIA
    The population of formal businesses in Romania consists mostly of MSMEs in the services sector. The lat-
    est business registry data, which only covers formal MSMEs, suggests that the country had 428,585 formal busi-
    nesses in 2019. Among formal firms, micro businesses (0–9 employees) account for the largest share, at 88
    percent (figure 1.2, panel a). Among micro firms, around 15 percent is self-employment. Yet, large firms play a sig-
    nificant role in the labor market, accounting for 34 percent total employment.7 Most firms in Romania are in the
    services sector, with significant participation in knowledge-intensive services. These are followed by firms in the
    retail, construction, tourism, and wholesale sectors (figure 1.2, panel b). Modern economic activities, such as digi-
    tal businesses and high-tech manufacturing have smaller shares, in line with what is observed in other economies.

    A large share of firms is young and concentrated around the Bucharest-Ilfov region. Almost 40 percent of reg-
    istered firms in Romania are less than 6 years of age (figure 1.2, panel c). The region of Bucharest-Ilfov hosts the
    most formal firms (24 percent), followed by North-West and Centre. The Bucharest-Ilfov and North-West regions
    not only have the largest concentration in absolute number of firms but also have the largest density of firms in
    per capita terms (figure 1.2, panel d), suggesting that the two regions lead the number of entrepreneurial activi-
    ties even when controlling for population size across regions. These regional differences are investigated further in
    chapter 3, which identifies the potential of the local ecosystems based on characteristics of firms’ agglomeration.

	1.3	 ENTREPRENEURSHIP                                                    PERFORMANCE
     IN ROMANIA
     This section assesses entrepreneurship performance in Romania along three key dimensions: (i) entry and exit,
     (ii) scale-up, and (iii) technological upgrade and innovation. Peer countries for comparison were selected through
     two steps. First, we conducted a cluster analysis using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s
     (OECD’s) Structural and Demographic Business Statistics.8 This model identified countries from the Central and
     Eastern European region, the Baltics, Scandinavia, Western Europe, Southern Europe, the Middle East, and Latin
     America. Following presentation of the cluster analysis and proposed list of comparator countries, the North-East
     Regional Development Agency suggested additional peer and aspirational benchmark countries. As a result of these
     exercises, we benchmark entrepreneurship performance in Romania using cross-country comparison indicators from
     Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Slovakia.



	1.3.1	 ENTRY                      AND EXIT
     The birth rate of enterprises in Romania is around 11 percent, which is the average among national peers. Since
     2015, the number of firms has increased significantly. Micro firms, in particular, experienced a 120 percent growth
     from 2011 to 2019. From 2011 to 2015, 21,695 new companies were registered in Romania. From 2015 to 2019,


     8. This database was selected because it includes indicators on the total number of active enterprises and enterprise birth and death rates
     in 40 countries. Peer and aspiration countries were selected based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and other relevant variables,
     including labor force participation rate, labor force with advanced education, compound annual growth rate, and new business entry rate.

this number jumped to 86,309 new businesses. Figure 1.3 compares the birth rate of enterprises, defined as the
share of new enterprises with respect to the total population of firms, across countries. For the selected counterpart
countries, the proportion of newly created businesses as a share of active firms has averaged around 11.5 percent.
In Romania, the same indicator was around 11 and 12 percent between 2016 and 2018. Enterprise birth rates
are higher in Estonia (12.4 percent), Portugal (15.7 percent), Hungary (13.3 percent), and Slovakia (12.6 percent).

New business density in Romania is high compared to peers with similar per capita income. New business
density refers to the number of new registered firms normalized by the working age population. New business den-
sity in Romania (6.5) is higher than would be predicted based on the cross-country relationship based on the lat-
est information available across countries and controlling for per capita income (figure 1.4).

       Net business population growth, which takes into consideration entry and exit rates, decreased between 2016
       and 2019. Net business population growth captures the change in national business counts and sheds light on the
       overall degree of geographical dispersion in business activity between countries. Comparator countries with the
       highest net business creation rates over this period are Hungary (8.9 percent) and the Netherlands (5.7 percent),
       as compared to Romania (3.2 percent) where there is a downward trend (figure 1.5). Yet, overall performance in
       terms of average net growth in Romania is close to the average observed across peers over the 2016–19 period.

       Although Romania has a relatively high entry rate, its firms are less likely to achieve high growth. Romania’s
       business population has increased—growing by 10 percent between 2014 and 2018. However, the share of high-
       growth firms9 in Romania has been stable, hovering around 3 percent between 2016 and 2018 (figure 1.6).
       Moreover, the share of high-growth firms in Romania is well below that in peer countries, which averages 11.4 per-
       cent. Only a small number of high-growth firms are hiring many employees (Flachenecker et al. 2020). The share
       of high-growth firms in the manufacturing sector is particularly small compared to that in other countries. This
       trend is also observed among young firms. Romania also has few young high-growth firms (5 years or younger).

       annum, over a three-year period, and with ten or more employees at the beginning of the observation period” where growth can be measured in
       number of employees or in turnover (OECD-Eurostat 2007; OECD 2010).

	1.3.3	INNOVATION

     Romanian firms are also less likely to innovate than the EU average. Around 10 percent of Romanian firms
     report that they innovated—introduced a new or significantly improved process or service in the previous twelve
     months—while the EU average is 60 percent (Eurostat 2018). Like those in other countries, small firms in Romania
     are less likely to innovate than large firms. In Romania, large firms are twice as innovative as smaller firms, but
     across the EU the difference is only 30 percent (figure 1.7).

      Note: An enterprise is considered innovative if, during the reference period, it successfully introduced a product or process innovation, had ongoing
      innovation activities, abandoned innovation activities, completed but had not yet introduced an innovation, or was engaged in in-house R&D or R&D

     Few Romanian firms introduce new products. Romanian firms lag their international peers in all types of innovation (fig-
     ure 1.8). The gap is especially large for innovation of new products—24 percent of firms in the EU report introducing new
     products, compared to only 4 percent of firms in Romania. In contrast to what is observed at the EU level, however, female
     entrepreneurs in Romania are more likely than male entrepreneurs to offer new products and services (24.9 percent
     vs. 22.3 percent). Romania’s low performance on innovation is also reflected in other metrics. The European Innovation
     Scoreboard highlights the low performance of Romania with respect to the EU regarding non-research and development
     (non-R&D) innovation expenditures, business process innovation, and employment in innovative enterprises.10

	1.3.4	 THE                               IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON ROMANIAN FIRMS
      The challenges for scaling up and innovating might be exacerbated by the COVID-19 shock. Overall, the anal-
      ysis on entrepreneurship performance suggests a dynamic process of new firms entering the market in Romania
      (quantity), but a significant gap regarding quality, described by the low share of firms reaching high-growth status
      and innovating. Evidence across countries suggests that this gap between quantity and quality of firms may be
      exacerbated in the context of COVID-19, as the number of new registered firms has been increasing, along with
      poor performance of existing businesses. Yet, the increasing adoption of digital technologies across businesses
      of diverse size, sector, and region, may also provide an opportunity for innovation and technology upgrade.

      Romanian firms have been affected significantly by COVID-19, and the effects of the crisis are heterogenous
      across firms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank launched a Business Pulse Survey to assess how
      Romanian firms have been impacted by COVID-19 and the impact of public sector support measures to mitigate
      business losses. Firms experienced a significant negative shock, with sales dropping by more than a third (rela-
      tive to 2019) in the first wave, during the initial phases of the lockdown and COVID-19 crisis between May and
      July 2020. Sales dropped 22 percent during the second wave, between September and October 2020 (figure 1.9,
      panel a). However, not all firms experienced the same negative shock. Small and micro firms were disproportion-
      ally affected (figure 1.9, panel b). The negative shock was also persistent. Firms that experienced a negative shock
      in the first wave also experienced a negative shock in the second wave, a few months later.

      During the pandemic, firms significantly increased the adoption and use of digital technologies. Although the
      pandemic is characterized by recurring waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, and cash-strapped Romanian firms anticipate
      ongoing cash flow challenges, digital adoption is a clear silver lining (figure 1.10). An estimated 91 percent of firms
      use digital technology, of which 22 percent started using
      technology and 34 percent increased the use during the
      first COVID-19 wave in the country. Adoption of digital FIGURE 1.10  Fraction of Businesses Starting or

     firms and local economic contexts unevenly. For digitalization to spur a productivity-driven recovery, it must concen-
     trate on business functions with the highest potential to spur upgrade and firm growth (Cirera et al. 2020). In Ro-
     mania, firm digitalization is concentrated in business functions such as marketing, sales, and business administra-
     tion, but it is important to facilitate the extension of these gains towards technologies applied to production as well.

     Access to public support related to the pandemic is tapering off and still very unequally distributed. Most firms
     did not receive any support. Although smaller firms were more affected by the crisis in terms of their drop in sales,
     they were less likely to access public support. The program that appears to have reached the largest number of
     firms is wage subsidies, but only 15 percent of firms said they had received this type of support by wave 2. There
     are significant opportunities to improve access to public support because the two main reasons preventing firms
     from receiving it are lack of awareness and cumbersome (and costly) application procedures.




	1.4	 ENTREPRENEURSHIP                                            PILLARS IN ROMANIA
     This section assesses the factors that characterize the entrepreneurship ecosystem pillars. As introduced in
     the conceptual framework, this report takes an ecosystem perspective, viewing entrepreneurship as an activity
     that arises from a set of complementary factors, such as knowledge and resources, available through institutions
     and individuals within a region. As illustrated in figure 1.1 above, this ecosystem perspective is based on three
     pillars comprising supply factors, demand factors, and barriers to the accumulation and allocation of resources.




	1.4.1	 SUPPLY         FACTORS
     Entrepreneurs and firms need physical capital and infrastructure, human capital, and knowledge as inputs
     for producing goods and providing services. The availability of these factors in the ecosystem plays a key role for
     entrepreneurs when deciding whether to start a new business, expand, or innovate. Firstly, physical infrastructure
     is the backbone of the economy. Lately, increasing attention has been given to the importance of ICT infrastruc-
     ture because evidence suggests that it may have an important effect on growth and the diffusion of new tech-
     nologies (Toader et al. 2018). Thus, this section pays particular attention to this topic. It complements the anal-
     ysis by assessing some indicators on the availability of human capital, with an emphasis on science, technology,
     engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and digital skills, as well as the availability of R&D and business knowl-
     edge present in institutions and through collaboration between research organizations and the private sector.



     Physical Capital and Infrastructure

     Over the last decade, Romania has been proactively investing in its digital infrastructure, but ICT usage by
     households and firms still lags EU peers. Figure 1.11 shows that about 81 percent of firms in Romania have fixed
     broadband connections as compared to 92 percent of firms in EU. The gap between Romanian and EU access
     to fixed broadband connections is also observed with respect to households, which may play an important role
     as workers and consumer markets. Worryingly, almost 20 percent of Romanians have never used the Internet,
     and less than a third only have basic digital skills, with a notable divide between rural and urban users. Although
     ICT usage remains relatively low, the COVID-19 pandemic expanded the use and adoption of digital technologies.

     Physical infrastructure is also relevant, especially with the observed increase in e-commerce, because it
     enables supply and delivery of goods across regions.11 Romania’s main cities and commuting zones are rela-
     tively sparsely distributed compared with much of the rest of the EU (European Commission 201612). Where cit-
     ies are far from each other, transport infrastructure can compensate for distance. However, indicators such as the

that Romania lags the EU average, ranking 24 of 26 countries. As a result, Romanian innovators and entrepre-
neurs face higher barriers—including to supplying and distributing goods across the country and physically meet-
ing other members of the ecosystem (such as cofounders and VCs)—than those in other EU countries.

  data available)—Finland has the highest number with 19 (OECD 2021b). Moreover, the share of R&D personnel
  in businesses is similarly low with only 36 percent of all R&D personnel working in businesses (figure 1.13). Re-
  latedly, industry perceptions of the graduates’ quality of skills needed by businesses rank below the European
  average. According to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (2019).15 Romania scores 3.5
  (scores range from 1 [not at all] to 7 [to a great extent]), whereas the European average is over 4.2, indicating
  a gap in needed skills including areas of entrepreneurship (figure 1.14). One potential explanation for the gap
  may be “brain drain” (Gavriloaia 2020). According to Eurostat,16 in 2017, a significantly larger share of Romani-
  ans with a doctorate, masters, or college degree were living in a state different than the one in which they were
  born, compared to 2008. The differences amount to 144 percent between 2017 and 2008. The regional ine-
  quality and significant concentration of activities in the capital city indicate the potential challenge facing sever-
  al subnational ecosystems.

  case, the answer ranges from 1 (not at all) to 7 (to a great extent).


  Moreover, there is significant room for improving basic digital skills among workers in Romania. Digital skills
  are key for innovative firms and startups, but they are also important for driving demand and consumption of dig-
  ital products and services. Figure 1.15 shows that less than one-third of people aged 16–74 have at least basic
  digital skills (58 percent in the EU as a whole), and only 10 percent have above basic digital skills (against the
  EU average of 33 percent).

There are also opportunities to address Romania’s human capital challenges via systematic diaspora engage-
ment. Box 1.1 below contains additional insights on Romanian diaspora, also referred to as Romanian emigrants.

Knowledge Capital

Public support for knowledge transfer is limited. Large public investments in R&D infrastructure and univer-
sity research are not translating into private sector innovation, and the limited capacity of subnational technol-
ogy transfer offices (TTOs) is a weakness in the institutional framework for commercialization. The lack of strong
mechanisms to build and transfer knowledge to businesses translates into low production of IP.

Despite large investments in R&D infrastructure projects, public sector investments are not translating into
private sector innovation. A high share of public R&D expenditures has been directed into a few flagship projects.
For example, with the European Commission, Romania co-invested around €320 million (equivalent of 30 percent
of the gross domestic R&D expenditure in 2019) into the Magurele Science Park, the largest research, innovation,
and development project in the country (Banila 2019). Although the park is important basic research infrastructure,
few incentives were built-in to ensure spillovers in the form of private-public collaboration. Despite large investments
in public R&D infrastructure projects, firms are not utilizing it for their growth, and knowledge spillover is limited.

Public sector investments in university research are also not translating into private sector innovation. Various
sources of information aiming to measure university-industry collaboration and collaboration between innovative
SMEs and other organizations (for example, European Commission 2021) suggest that Romania lags its counter-
parts (figure 1.16). This indicates that public sector investments are not translating into private sector outputs as
further highlighted by a low share of patents (see next paragraphs). Such linkages matter not only for ensuring the
translation of research and new ideas into real-world innovations but also for ensuring the relevance of university
teaching and research. Historically, Romanian universities have not developed strong linkages with the business
sector. Knowledge exchange activities are now legally enabled as part of a higher education institution’s mission,
but Romanian companies may not be proactively establishing linkages with universities given low levels of R&D
and limited technological specialization and knowledge intensity.

The limited capacity of subnational TTOs is a weakness in the institutional framework for commercialization.
A functional review of the Romanian R&D system (World Bank 2011) described the technology transfer infrastruc-
ture as a weak link in the sector, which could explain why few firms are innovating with other firms. The network of
institutions specialized in technology transfer and innovation (ReNITT) consisted of 39 accredited technology trans-
fer centers, technology info centers, and technology and business incubators in 2011. However, anecdotal evidence
from the North-East and North-West regions (for example, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Gheorghe Asachi Technical
University, University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca, and Babeș-Bolyai University) shows that most TTOs are
     Chapter 1  Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Romania: A Cross-Country Analysis                                                                       40




     very small, employing one or two people. Moreover, most TTOs are embedded within universities and are mainly trans-
     actional and used for patent applications. TTOs are more effective if they act as innovation brokers between ecosystem
     players, taking a more proactive, strategic role in encouraging spinoffs and facilitating cross-organizational innovation.

     The lack of strong mechanisms to build and transfer knowledge to businesses translates into low produc-
     tion of IP. Romania has around 20 patent applications per billion regional gross domestic product (GDP) in pur-
     chasing power standards (PPS), but its peers Poland, Croatia, and Bulgaria have each over 30 patent applica-
     tions per billion GDP, and innovation leaders such as Israel have over 140 patent applications per billion GDP
     (European Commission 2020a). In Romania, patents are usually applied for and granted as part of research activ-
     ities, merely to satisfy funding instrument requirements, and mostly without a clear commercialization strategy.
     Limited resources and lack of a strategic approach also mean that most patent applications are national rather
     than EU or international, which has implications for the quality of those patents.




	1.4.2	 DEMAND             FACTORS
     Demand plays a crucial role in a healthy ecosystem. Expanding markets for new and incumbent enterprises and
     having firms and entrepreneurs with capabilities to convert innovative ideas into businesses are crucial. Even if
     the supply pillar provides resources (in the form of physical, human, and knowledge capital) and the allocation
     pillar enables the allocation of such resources towards productive firms (through access to finance, appropriate
     regulations, and social capital), the ecosystem must have access to markets, skilled entrepreneurs, and capable
     firms to demand and use these resources in production and service provision.



     Access to Markets

     Romania is a mid-size market, with an estimated population of 20 million consumers. Even when the capa-
     bilities of existing firms are limited, expanding access to markets (customers) can help businesses scale produc-
     tion and increase product quality.17 Romania successfully diversified its export basket toward medium-technology
     products, although this transformation slowed after the 2007–08 global recession. Over the last two decades,
     Romania switched from labor-intensive low-technology sectors (such as garments, footwear, and metals) to more
     advanced sectors (like automotive, machinery, and electronic equipment) (World Bank 2018). Since 2008, export
     growth has increasingly been driven by existing products and markets and relied more on the intensive margin
     (that is, exports of the same products to the same markets). In the preceding decade, the extensive margin (that
     is, exports of new products or to new markets) accounted for almost half of export growth.

     Inefficiencies in Romania’s public procurement system severely limit domestic market access for SMEs. The
     EU’s Romania Country Report 2018 (European Commission 2018) highlights inefficiencies in Romania’s public
     procurement and concludes that “the irreversibility of the public procurement reform and further monitoring in
     the context of the EU Semester process remains essential.” The inefficiency is reflected in the EU Single Market
     Scoreboard,18 on which Romania scores unsatisfactorily on 9 out of 12 indicators, including SME contractors and
     SME bids.19 According to the most recent data available (2019), SMEs bid on 35 percent of public procurement
     contracts but are awarded only 5 percent of them. This indicates that there are barriers preventing smaller firms
     from participating in public procurement procedures.

     As for access to external markets, Romania has a low share of exporters compared to peers and low import con-
     tent of exports. Only 17 percent of Romanian firms export more than 1 percent of their sales abroad (figure 1.17,

panel a). Exports in three of the main high-technology products exported by Romania (medicinal and pharma, electri-
cal machinery and appliances, and scientific instruments) recorded low quality increases (3.6 percent, 1.9 percent and
1 percent respectively) between 1996 and 2010 that fell short of the quality increases in the automotive sector (8.8
percent) and were more in line with the quality performance of declining sectors like clothing and footwear. Romanian
exporters tend to specialize in assembly, low-value-added, and downstream labor-intensive segments of global value
chains. High-technology exports exhibit the lowest survival probabilities in Romania, with less than 10 percent of
export relationships surviving more than 5 years. Moreover,20 the import content of exports is relatively low compared
to country peers (figure 1.17, panel b), which suggests that facilitating access to imports should be a relevant com-
ponent when designing and implementing policies aimed at supporting firms with high-growth potential.21 Together,
figure 1.17 panels a and b reveal that Romania’s share of exports and imports is low compared to peer countries.

Use of e-Commerce and Digital Platforms

Analysis for the World Bank flagship Europe 4.0: Addressing the Digital Dilemma indicates that Romania can
reap benefits from continuing to adopt new transactional technologies. Transactional technologies, such as
digital commerce platforms and blockchain, better match supply and demand to facilitate market transactions by
lowering information asymmetries. They thereby hold the promise to both promote market inclusion of small and
young firms and foster the convergence of Romanian catching-up regions. Higher use of online sales is associated
with smaller productivity gaps between large and small firms in sectors using online sales intensively.

Use of e-commerce remains low in Romania. Prior to COVID-19, fewer than 10 percent of firms in Romania had
conducted sales on an e-commerce platform (figure 1.18). Moreover, between 2014 and 2018, Romania expe-
rienced a five percent decline in the share of firms using business-to-consumer (B2C) websites or apps to sell
online (Hallward-Driemeier et al. 2020). Internet purchases by individuals in Romania are also low—9 percent of
Romanians have made a purchase online, slightly lower than the EU average of 11 percent (figure 1.19). These
two figures are complementary because sales on e-commerce platforms (supply) are a function of Internet pur-
chases by individuals (demand). EU membership alone has not enabled countries such as Romania to signifi-
cantly scale up their use of digital technologies.22


20. The import content of exports is the share of imported inputs in the overall exports of a country and reflects the extent to which a country is
a user of foreign inputs (OECD 2021a).
21. Cruz, Baghdadi, and Arouri (2021) show that an increase in import barriers led by changes in non-tariff measures reduces the likelihood of
achieving high-growth status through import channels.

Uptake of e-commerce platforms has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Romania saw the share of
firms selling online rise to 19 percent in 2020 from 9 percent in 2018. However, there remains vast unrealized
potential: less than 20 percent of firms received even 1 percent of their revenue via online sales.



Firm Capabilities

Although top managers have good work experience, Romanian firms provide little employee training. Better firm
capabilities mean a greater capacity for new and existing firms to adopt new technologies and recognize opportunities
and risk. Top managers in Romania have an average of 19.8 years of experience working in the firm’s sector, compa-
rable with the EU average of 20.6 years (figure 1.20, panel a). However, only 20.5 percent of Romanian firms offer
formal training to their employees, whereas the EU average is 34.7 percent (figure 1.20, panel b). This not only hin-
ders the collective efforts to be innovative but also lowers the technological absorption capacity of the organization.

              Entrepreneurial Characteristics

              Self-reported intentions to start a business in Romania are high, but many of these businesses are driven
              by necessity rather than by the pursuit of opportunities. The entrepreneurial intentions of Romanians aged
              18–64 years old are higher than in comparator countries. In 2015, for example, 29 percent of 18–64-year-olds in
              Romania were “latent entrepreneurs” and stated intent to start a business within three years (figure 1.21, panel
              a). However, many of these businesses are not driven by opportunities. Rather, “necessity entrepreneurship” is
              the dominant type of entrepreneurship in Romania (figure 1.21, panel b). Although Romania’s self-employment
              rate of 16.4 percent in 2017 is above the EU average of 13.7 percent (OECD 2017), many of these businesses
              are considered necessity-driven enterprises because they were created due to limited opportunities in the labor
              market. Three in ten businesses were created because the entrepreneurs did not have any other opportunities in
              the labor market. The share of entrepreneurs pushed by necessity was higher than the EU average in all observed
              demographic groups.

	1.4.3	       BARRIERS TO ALLOCATION AND ACCUMULATION OF RESOURCES
              Entrepreneurs with good business ideas and opportunities need access to finance, adequate regulations,
              and a favorable environment to acquire resources and succeed. Firm growth is often constrained by the availa-
              bility of funding, typically preventing new ventures from investing in innovative projects. This interferes with firms’
              ability to improve productivity, finance their growth, and meet working capital requirements and market demand.
              Entrepreneurs also benefit from an efficient business environment with clear rules, reducing unnecessary bureau-
              cratic steps, and a culture that stimulates appetite for risk, builds social capital, and promotes trust.


              Access to Finance

              SMEs and startups typically require different sources of financing. Most SMEs can obtain loans from commercial
              banks. However, entrepreneurs with novel and unverifiable technologies struggle to receive funding from commer-
              cial banks because it is difficult to conduct due diligence and estimate the returns from risky projects. Moreover,
              the assets of innovative young firms often consist of intangibles such as patents, user-networks and branding,

which are much harder to value and borrow against than tangible assets such as machinery. Hence, startups typ-
ically self-finance (including borrowing from friends and family), seek grant funding, or raise investments from
accelerators, angel investors, and venture capital (VC) funds. Several financial institutions (including banks, VCs,
angels, crowdfunding) provide access to financial capital in Romania. At the end of 2019, the Romanian banking
sector included 34 credit institutions. However, it lacks geographical diversity and, more importantly, access for
all stages of a company’s growth.



SME Finance

The share of domestic credit to the private sector in Romania is low. Within Europe, the share of domestic cred-
it to the private sector (as a share of GDP) is the highest in Portugal, Finland, Estonia, and Slovakia, but Romania
and Hungary are catching up (figure 1.22). The prevalence of bank loans in Romania is lower than the EU aver-
age (this funding is accessed by 39 percent of SMEs in
Romania, compared to 49 percent for the EU-2823 av-
erage). The private lending interest rate is highest in FIGURE 1.22  Access to Finance through Domestic

Startup Finance

Sources of startup financing range depending on the firm lifecycle. During the ideation stage, firms typically
self-finance, receive grants, or leverage crowdfunding platforms. During the seed stage, firms start to expand
sources of financing to include angel investments. In some instances, organic growth via sales help keep com-
panies afloat. During the growth stages, typically associated with larger investment rounds, startups seek invest-
ment from VC funds. It can take years for technology-intensive startups to start generating profits, and many are
susceptible to the “valley of death.”24 See figure 1.23 for additional details.

Funding for early-stage pipeline-building—smaller firms and nascent startups—remains limited. Romanian pub-
lic sector financing mechanisms are not tailored for small firms and startups because they tend to favor post-rev-
enue firms, which may have the effect of supporting incumbents over new entrants. Moreover, equity and debt
financing for research and development remain below the EU average (European Commission 2017). This is in
line with the findings discussed in the Knowledge Capital section. However, smaller average deal sizes contribute
to low levels of equity financing in Romania.

24. The “valley of death” refers to a period from inception to product market fit during which a startup has to rely largely on money from invest-
ment to survive. During this period, startups have begun operations but have not yet generated revenue. Startups can be susceptible to valley
of death at multiple stages of their lifecycle. See figure 1.23.

Due to the high-risk profile of nascent startups, the public sector may play a catalytic role. During the ideation
and incubation stages, also referred to as pre-seed financing, startups typically self-finance or receive grant funding.
According to the European Commission’s review of public funds for entrepreneurship, existing startup instruments
are mainly small scale, below €50,000 (European Commission 2017). See chapter 2 for additional analysis from
the World Bank’s review of public expenditures for entrepreneurship. Based on available data regarding pre-seed
and seed rounds, it is estimated that earlier stage startups face a financing gap between €50,000 and €200,000.

Romania has 14 active networks for business angels, totaling more than 250 investors, which could be impor-
tant financing and mentorship resources for startups. In addition to acceleration programs, angel networks
represent important sources of funding for seed stage firms. Although the other angel investment25 communities
remain informal, Romania’s first business angel association was formalized and joined the European Business
Angels Network (EBAN). According to 2021 data tracked by Cluj-based incubator, Activize, 54 startups received a
total of €18 million from angel investments and equity crowdfunding campaigns.

Romanian VC investment as a share of GDP and VC deals are also lower than the EU average. Within Europe,
VC investments as a share of GDP are the highest in Finland and Estonia but the lowest in Romania and Bulgaria
(figure 1.24). Although the compound annual growth rate of total VC investments in Romania is in line with the EU
average, Romania’s growth would need to be considerably above the EU average in order to reach a similar level
of total VC investments. According to PitchBook (2020), VC deals in Europe totaled €10.6 billion in third quarter
(Q3) 2020. That is one of the strongest quarters on record, bringing year-to-date funding to €29.5 billion (in 2019,
a total of €37.2 billion was raised). There is, however, a large gap between first-time rounds and follow-on rounds
of funding. In the first 9 months of 2020, 93.4 percent of all VC funding in Europe went to follow-on rounds. The



25. Angel investing, which is the practice of private individuals investing personal capital into private companies, is typically associated with
startup and early-stage firms with high-risk profiles. Angel investors are particularly valuable in supporting young firms because they are often
committed to providing non-capital support such as mentoring, guidance on developing business strategies, industry or commercial connec-
tions, and follow-on funding.

median deal size is $1.2 million for angel/seed, $2.7 million for early-stage VC, and $5.9 million for later-stage VC
investments in Europe. In Romania, the average funding in 2020, at €552,000 per round, is similar to the previ-
ous year (2019), in a context of increased numbers of
seed rounds. (Without the UiPath transaction, the aver-

environment of 2008 and has quickly grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry that channels funds into hundreds of thousands of ventures glob-
ally. Hollywood has also used crowdfunding to finance movie projects.

   •	 €29.5 million raised in 15 growth rounds (over €1 million per round).



Regulation

Romania’s regulatory framework has not been conducive to competition. Until Romania joined the EU in January
2007, EU accession remained an anchor for reforms, providing momentum for the privatization and restructuring
of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and for regulatory and judiciary reforms. EU accession led to substantial de jure
reforms, which were often subsequently reversed or weakly implemented (World Bank 2018). The restrictiveness
of Romania’s regulatory environment is driven by state control and additional barriers to entrepreneurship. Pro-
competition regulation can help boost income per capita by increasing investment and employment, and it can
also stimulate firms to become more innovative and efficient. According to the product market regulation (PMR)
indicators,31 Romanian markets are more restrictive than those of newer EU member countries.

Romania’s regulatory framework makes it difficult to start businesses. Barriers to entrepreneurship include
an inefficient license and permits system and administrative burdens on startups (World Bank 2018). Some reg-
ulations prevent entrepreneurs from structuring their firms in the most appropriate way (for example, preventing
startups from compensating or rewarding staff with stock options, which is difficult under current legislation).

Investing in Romanian startups is also difficult due to regulatory uncertainties. Fundraising can also be par-
ticularly onerous: many entrepreneurs report that fundraising can become a full-time activity, diverting precious
attention away from building their business. Regulations that stimulate investments into startups are also criti-
cal because these types of firms typically do not qualify for debt financing from commercial banks. Romania has
regulations that target VC funding, but it lacks clear regulations to stimulate seed funding mechanisms, which
include angel investment and other forms of finance (including ‘alternative finance’ such as crowdfunding). At
present, angel investment and crowdfunding platforms have an unclear status within the Romanian regulatory
environment. The legal uncertainties may dissuade investors, especially those based overseas, from making the
sorts of investments that could turn ordinary tech startups into high-potential startups, which often receive equity
financing32 from angel investors, VC funds, or crowdfunding platforms. The Romanian entrepreneurship ecosys-
tems have raised this issue explicitly.33

Moreover, Romania’s insolvency framework makes it difficult for firms to “fail fast.” An insolvency framework
is critical for building a conducive environment for startups to “fail fast” so they can apply lessons to new entre-
preneurial ventures. However, evidence from the Business Pulse Surveys shows that Romania’s insolvency frame-
work and cost of bankruptcy are sub-optimal. It merits additional attention because firm closure is a natural and
expected way in which resources are reallocated in a healthy entrepreneurship ecosystem.

Romania lacks a single policymaking authority responsible for startups, including tech startups and high-poten-
tial startups. Existing institutions, including the Romanian Executive Agency for Funding Higher Education, Research,
Development and Innovation (UEFISCDI), originated from education and research and, thus, academic focus is part
of their culture. UEFISCDI is also needed to transform the R&D environment because Romania performs poorly on

31. Pro-competition regulation in the markets for goods and services can help boost living standards, can raise output per capita by increas-
ing investment and employment, and can encourage firms to be more innovative and efficient, thereby lifting productivity. To measure countries’
regulatory stance and to track reform progress over time, since 1998 the OECD has been producing a set of indicators of product market regu-
lation (PMR). This set includes an economy-wide indicator and a group of indicators that measures regulation in various sectors. The informa-
tion used to construct the PMR Indicators is collected through a PMR questionnaire. The questionnaire includes over 1,000 questions on econ-
omy-wide or industry-specific regulatory provisions. The information collected through the questionnaire is scored and aggregated into the PMR
indicators.
32. As discussed above, in the early days of team or company formation, startups typically self-finance or receive grants. Firms typically source
equity financing from seed stage onwards.
33. The Romanian ecosystem raised issues surrounding ease of starting a business and regulatory incentives to crowd-in private sector invest-
ment activity.
Chapter 1  Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Romania: A Cross-Country Analysis                                                                                48




the European Innovation Scoreboard (European Commission 2021) and focusing on startups would distract from
its core mission. Moreover, policies fostering the entrepreneurship ecosystem are quite specific due of the nature
of high-potential startups and require specialized expertise. Therefore, an institution targeting startups and scale-
ups needs to be very different from other agencies in terms of governance, capabilities, and overall agility to work
hand-in-hand with ecosystem players, investors, and policy circles. This was further validated by the functional
review of public support programs for entrepreneurship, showing that programs are generally risk averse and are
typically directed towards ‘safer,’ more established and already profitable firms (see section 2.1 Public Programs).
Therefore, a dedicated institution needs an appropriate understanding of the nature of startups—including tech
startups and high-potential startups—and new technologies to manage risk instead of seeking to minimize it.

The need for Romania to have a central policymaking authority for startups is widely recognized. In fact, it has
already been recognized by the Romanian ecosystem itself34 and by the EU in a report on startups in Romania
(European Commission 2017). In addition, several European and international peer and aspirational ecosystems
have established entrepreneurship agencies that implement programs targeting startups and high-tech firms.
These countries include Chile (Chile’s Economic Development Corporation [CORFO] and the Startup Chile accel-
eration program), France (La Mission French Tech), Poland (Startup Poland), Portugal (Startup Portugal), Serbia
(Digital Serbia Initiative and Innovation Fund), Luxembourg (House of Entrepreneurship), among many others.



Culture and Social Capital

In Romania, entrepreneurship is accorded reasonably high social status, increasingly considered a desirable
career choice, and widely promoted by the media. Seventy-five percent of 18–64-year-olds in Romania believe
that successful entrepreneurs have high status, much higher than in Croatia (47 percent) and close to the share
in the Netherlands (76 percent) (figure 1.25). Entrepreneurship is also often promoted as a potential career path-
way in the media, including through many European Social Fund programs.

status. This indicator is based on the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’s Adult Population Survey, which tracks the entrepreneurial attitudes, activity, and
aspirations of individuals. It is administered to a minimum of 2,000 adults in each country.


Romania ranks low on indicators of social capital, performing weakest on institutional trust and civic and
social participation. This low social capital, which has been observed by the EU (European Commission 2017)
is also evident in the ecosystem where stakeholders reported siloed networks and limited collaboration and con-
nectedness between stakeholders, reinforcing the perception of ecosystem fragmentation. There also appears to
be a limited “give back” mentality in Romania. During the early stages of company establishment, startups rely
on critical business advisory support mechanisms including business coaching, technical guidance, and mentor-
ship. Romania’s limited “give back” culture could be constraining the growth of startups that rely on mentorship
from seasoned business experts.

             AND CHALLENGES
	1.5	 STRENGTHS
   FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ROMANIA
   Romania’s entrepreneurship performance is characterized by high entry rates and low levels of scaling up
   and innovation compared to regional and global peers. Although firm entry seems stable and relatively high
   for Romania’s per capital income level, the share of high-growth firms and firms promoting innovation are signif-
   icantly smaller than in peer countries. Thus, the main challenge faced by the national entrepreneurship ecosys-
   tem in Romania is mostly related to the intensive margin (scaling up and innovating), which captures challenges
   associated with the quality of entrepreneurship. Table 1.2 summarizes some of the key strengths and challenges
   associated with entrepreneurship performance and the pillars of the ecosystem at the national level, as described
   within this chapter.

   This summary provides a broad perspective on a complex system. Many of the key factors necessary to strength-
   en Romania’s entrepreneurship ecosystem are structural and require investment, resources, and time to mature.
   Moreover, there are unknowns in terms of effectiveness of policy interventions in this area. The high-level assess-
   ment described in this chapter is intended to help with the identification of key priority areas for which further ex-
   periments, a more detailed diagnostic, and more precise interventions are needed.
Chapter 1  Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in Romania: A Cross-Country Analysis                                                                  50




To propose more specific interventions, more information is needed about available resources, the poten-
tial of local entrepreneurship ecosystems, and the challenges they face. It is key to understand the resources
available to support entrepreneurship activity, both from the public sector and from ecosystem enablers. It is
also important to identify the potential of local entrepreneurship ecosystems—based on specific sector-regions in
Romania—and understand these challenges across them. There is also significant variation regarding strengths
and challenges of local ecosystems, taking into consideration their sectoral and regional characteristics. Thus,
identifying the potential of local entrepreneurship ecosystems and their specific challenges would allow for more
customized and effective interventions. The next chapters aim to address these issues.

CHAPTER 2 



STARTUPS AND LOCAL
ENTREPRENEURSHIP
ECOSYSTEMS
Chapter 2  Startups and Local Entrepreneurship Ecosystems                                                           52




   KEY QUESTIONS
   Chapter 2 analyzes the subnational landscape of businesses and assess the potential of Romania’s
   local entrepreneurship ecosystems with a focus on tech startups. First, it provides an overall perspec-
   tive on the distribution of firms and entrepreneurship performance at the subnational level. Second, the
   chapter identifies the potential of local entrepreneurship ecosystems through agglomerations of firms in
   technology-intensive sectors in terms of the quality of the firms and the diversity of their economic activ-
   ities. Third, it analyzes the results of the World Bank Group Romania Startup Survey—a new nationally
   representative dataset collected for this report. Finally, the chapter uses network analysis to identify the
   connectedness of key actors of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Romania.

   This chapter aims to address the following questions:

   •	How is economic activity distributed regionally within Romania?

   •	Where are the more technology-intensive regional ecosystems in Romania?

   •	What are the key characteristics of tech startups in Romania?

   •	What are the key obstacles reported by tech startups in Romania?

   •	How does connectedness play out among Romania’s ecosystems?




A national perspective on the outcomes and pillars of entrepreneurship ecosystems is critical, but entrepre-
neurship and startup growth are localized phenomena. The aggregate analysis of entrepreneurship and the
startup ecosystem in the previous chapter helps identify critical barriers and provides the “big picture,” but a coun-
try could have numerous local ecosystems of varied depth and sectoral focus. The enterprises in these ecosystems
might also vary in sophistication, from subsistence micro-businesses, through tech startups, to spinoffs from large
companies. As such, these local ecosystems could have different potential for growth and may require different pol-
icy interventions. Therefore, targeting interventions to local environments and specific sectors may be necessary.

Local entrepreneurship ecosystems are inextricably linked with their immediate surrounding environment and
sector-specific needs. As Audretsch et al. (2012) put it, the “fortunes of regions and entrepreneurs are intertwined.”
The environment plays an important role in shaping the critical factors that enable entrepreneurs to enhance pro-
ductivity and competitiveness. As described in the conceptual framework at the beginning of this report, starting a
business, ensuring it survives and eventually expands, and contributing to overall economic development depend
on the quality of nine factors over three pillars combined with effective policy instruments and ecosystem enablers.
Most of these factors are local and are difficult to move across sectors and regions. Resources (physical, human,
and knowledge capital) face mobility costs both geographically and across sectors. Factors that facilitate access
to them (such as regulations and access to finance) can vary significantly across sectors and regions. Similarly,
factors that influence demand (for example, access to markets) are also sector- and region-specific.

Identifying potential entrepreneurship ecosystems and assessing their pillars are important prerequisites for
designing well-targeted effective policies and interventions. This chapter begins by describing some key differences
between the regions in Romania. Then, it identifies potential subnational ecosystems. It applies a new methodology
for identifying and assessing local entrepreneurship ecosystems that combines data on density, diversity, and quality
of firms (Cruz, Torres, and Trang, 2021). As a final step, the chapter presents a connectedness analysis, which helps
us understand the relationships between entities in the ecosystem and the regional interdependencies. The results
of this section are key to target interventions at a regional level based on inferences from local sectoral ecosystems.

This chapter examines and spotlights the potential of local entrepreneurship ecosystems with particular focus
on tech startups. A key message from Chapter 1 is that, despite a relatively high entry rate of new firms, Romania’s
entrepreneurship performance is challenged by low levels of innovation and scale up. But innovation and scaling

    up are strongly associated with firms that succeed in digital and high-tech sectors, which we examine further in this
    chapter. The analysis relies on firm-level data from four sources (box 2.1): the Romania Business Registry, private
    data sources on startups (CB Insights and PitchBook), and new evidence from the World Bank’s Romania Startup
    Survey, which collected two samples for this report, one on tech startups, and one on high-potential Startups.


        BOX 2.1  Firm-Level Data Used in the Analysis
        The analysis in this chapter relies on a rich firm-level data-               on tech startups or digitalized firms that would be attrac-
        set combining four sources:                                                  tive for VC or private equity investors due to certain inno-

        characteristics, operations, and dynamics such as revenue,                   tech startups that have successfully managed to scale up
        employment, and sector. MSME operations in Romania cut                       through VC, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions.

    ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ROMANIA
    There is high economic, entrepreneurial, and technological disparity between Romania’s regions. The geo-
    graphic distribution of firms in Romania reflects significant regional disparity.35 There is a large concentration of
    firms in the Bucharest-Ilfov region (figure 2.1, panel a), which is also the richest in terms of GDP per capita (160
    PPS in percent of the EU-27 average in 2019).36 Although the highest concentration of economic and entrepre-
    neurial activity is in Bucharest-Ilfov, Mehedinti and Covasna have the lowest concentration of such activity.

    Entrepreneurship dynamics (the entry and exit of firms) also varies across regions. The Bucharest-Ilfov region
    has the highest rate of firm creation, while Harghita has the lowest (figure 2.1, panel b). Hunedoara, Mehedinti
    and Caras-Severin have the highest rate of firm exit (figure 2.1, panel c). In addition, the number of high growth

    West Oltenia and West), and 42 counties.
    36. The volume index of GDP per capita in purchasing power standards (PPS) is expressed in relation to the European Union average set to
    equal 100. If the index of a country is higher than 100, this country’s level of GDP per head is higher than the EU average and vice versa.

remained constant, with a small decline in the North-West and West regions.

Having a high entry rate of new firms is a signal of potential dynamism in the ecosystem, but it is not in itself
a sufficient condition for a dynamic ecosystem. An important question associated with the entry rate is the qual-
ity of the entrepreneurs and firms that are starting businesses. High exit rates may reflect lack of opportunities for
expanding and surviving, although exit rates can also increase if less efficient firms are leaving the market, and
this space is being occupied by more productive firms.

Bucharest-Ilfov also has the highest share of young and high-growth firms, again suggesting that it is the
most advanced local entrepreneurship ecosystem. Evidence from the United States and other advanced econ-
omies suggests that young high-growth firms are responsible for a significant chunk of the new jobs created in an
economy over time (Haltiwanger et al. 2013, 2017). South-West Oltenia and West have the lowest concentration
of young and high-growth firms (table 2.1), while North-East and Bucharest-Ilfov have the highest employment
rate in the country (72 percent) and Centre and West have the lowest rate (60.3 percent). Ten percent of the total


37. Using the OECD-Eurostat definition of high-growth firms as “[a]ll enterprises with average annualized growth greater than 20 percent per
annum, over a three-year period, and with ten or more employees at the beginning of the observation period” where growth can be measured in
number of employees or in turnover (OECD-Eurostat 2007; OECD 2010).

Human capital is a key comparative advantage in Bucharest-Ilfov. According to Eurostat (2020), the popula-
tion in Bucharest-Ilfov has the most education (40.5 percent have completed tertiary education), followed by the
North-West (20.1 percent) and Centre (17.1 percent) (figure 2.2). Similarly, the Bucharest-Ilfov region has the high-
est concentration of human capital working on science and technology, and the highest number of R&D person-
nel and researchers in comparison to the rest of the country. Bucharest-Ilfov also has the highest R&D expend-
iture in the country (1.1 percent of its GDP); the second highest expenditure is in the West region (0.4 percent
of its GDP). This concentration of human capital in Bucharest-Ilfov is a key factor for the development of knowl-
edge-intensive activities in this region, which is also associated with the availability of a more complex knowledge
system supporting firms. Appendix D compiles information on other pillars by region.

Note: Human resources in research and technology refers to the share of active population in the age group 15–74 that is classified as human resources in
science and technology (HRST), that is, having successfully completed an education at the third level or being employed in science and technology. GDP =
gross domestic product; R&D = research and development.

 The distribution of human capital and knowledge, along with other resources, across local ecosystems is
 also reflected in the sectoral specialization across regions. Every region has its own productive strengths and
 knowledge specializations. The disparity between the regional distribution of firms in the country can also be
 observed through the concentration of human capital by sector in each region (figure 2.3). Most digital, knowl-
 edge-intensive and wholesale enterprises, in services, as well as most high-tech manufacturing enterprises,
 in industry, are concentrated in Bucharest-Ilfov. However, mining and oil firms are mostly concentrated in the
 North-West region, while other primary industries are concentrated in the Centre region. Most agro-industrial
 and light manufacturing firms are more spread throughout the country, with the highest concentration in the
 South-East and South-Muntenia regions, and in the North-West and Centre regions respectively. This distribu-
 tion of economic activities is common across the world: complex economic activities (such as ICT and biotech-
 nology) tend to concentrate in a few urban areas, while less complex economic sectors tend to be widely dis-
 persed (Balland et al. 2020).

 Three technology-intensive sectors stand out as relevant for the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Bucharest-
 Ilfov, a region that plays a key role in entrepreneurship performance in Romania. Digital services, knowledge-in-
 tensive services, and high-tech manufacturing are disproportionately concentrated in the Bucharest-Ilfov ecosys-
 tem. These sectors have in common the fact that they are knowledge-intensive, but high-tech manufacturing is
 distinctly different from digital services and knowledge-intensive services—there are many fewer high-tech manu-
 facturing firms, but they tend to employ many more people than digital services or knowledge-intensive services
 firms (figure 2.4). Combined, digital services, knowledge-intensive services, and high-tech manufacturing account
 for about 24 percent of formal firms in Romania and 20 percent of jobs. An important characteristic of these sec-
 tors is that they tend to be composed of firms that are relatively more productive and provide better jobs than
 firms in other sectors.

               LOCAL TECHNOLOGY-INTENSIVE
	2.2	 IDENTIFYING
    ENTREPRENEURSHIP ECOSYSTEMS
    An important step for the design of policies to support entrepreneurship is to identify geographic locations
    with high potential. The identification of local entrepreneurship ecosystems is key for three reasons. First, it iden-
    tifies regions that have similar potential for specific entrepreneurial activities. This means that specific policies
    could be applied for an ecosystem that comprises several cities or counties. Second, it identifies the ecosystems´
    maturity, which signals the level of interventions required to develop them. For instance, an incipient ecosystem
    would require different and more numerous measures in comparison with a maturing ecosystem. Finally, it iden-
    tifies the specific indicators that the ecosystem is lacking.

    The existence and potential of local ecosystems can be captured by the sectoral diversity and quality of firms
    in a given location. Sectoral diversity is a key component for entrepreneurship and innovation. Diversity tells us
    how varied the productive knowledge base in a region is and is strongly associated with increased output, produc-
    tivity, and growth (Karlsson, Rickardsson, and Wincent 2019). Firm quality provides indications of business dyna-
    mism and the potential for additional growth.38

    Entrepreneurship ecosystems are characterized by the connectedness of actors through the share of ideas
    and knowledge and common interest for business transactions. Focusing on broad sectors helps capture the
    fact that entrepreneurship ecosystems share similar features in terms of market resources (for example, work-
    ers’ skills and knowledge capital), demand factors (access to market, quality of entrepreneurs), and barriers to
    allocation (such as regulation and access to finance). Because an ecosystem is characterized, in part, by the con-
    nections that lead to the transfer of resources and knowledge between relevant actors, it is important to delimit a
    broad sector of activities that captures common supply and demand factors, as well as barriers to allocation and
    accumulation of resources across firms.

    Therefore, to identify local entrepreneurship ecosystems, this section evaluates the diversity and quality of geo-
    graphical agglomerations of firms within a broad sector. It identifies and analyzes the potential of local entrepre-
    neurship ecosystems associated with four relevant sectors in Romania—digital services, knowledge-intensive ser-
    vices, high-tech manufacturing, and light-manufacturing—using data from the Romanian Business Registry. Digital
    services, knowledge-intensive services, and high-tech manufacturing were selected for their strategic potential as

being more technology-intensive activities. Light manufacturing provides a good comparison as a more traditional
activity that is still relevant for Romania. The methodology identifies agglomerations of firms across diverse sub-
sectors using a variety of quality indicators that are correlated across counties. Box 2.2 describes the algorithm
used to identify high potential ecosystems.

    annum, over a three-year period, and with ten or more employees at the beginning of the observation period” where growth can be measured in
    number of employees or in turnover (OECD-Eurostat 2007; OECD 2010).




The results show that digital services and knowledge-intensive services ecosystems are agglomerated around
a few large metropolitan areas (See figure 2.5.) Digital services firms are defined as those providing mostly dig-
ital content.39 Examples of digital services are transactional technologies that facilitate market transactions by

exploit the exponential growth of data and or reduce the cost of computing (such as cloud computing, big data
analytics, or machine learning), and operational technologies that combine data with physical automation (such
as smart robots, 3D printing, or the Internet of Things) (Hallward-Driemeier et al. 2020). Knowledge-intensive ser-
vices enterprises (Miles et al. 1995) are those whose employment structures are heavily weighted towards pro-
fessional and technical expertise. Examples of these firms are engineering services, research and experimental
development, and specialized health services.

Bucharest, in particular, stands out as a high-potential local ecosystem—both for digital business and for
knowledge-intensive services—characterized by relevant agglomeration in terms of the diversity and qual-
ity of firms. High-potential ecosystems in terms of diversity and quality in digital services and knowledge-inten-
sive services are disproportionally concentrated around Bucharest-Ilfov (figure 2.5). The counties of Constanta
and Craiova have relevant emerging ecosystems in terms of diversity of firms. Other counties, including Cluj and
Arges (for both digital businesses and knowledge-intensive services), Prahova (for digital); and Arad, Hunedoara,
Bacau, and Buzau also demonstrate initial conditions of incipient ecosystems (for at least one activity within dig-
ital business and knowledge-intensive services).

Potential high-tech manufacturing ecosystems tend to be more dispersed geographically, but there are also
few firms in those ecosystems. High-tech manufacturing in general refers to industries associated with the inten-
sive use of advanced technologies. These industries are associated with the manufacturing of pharmaceutical
products and pharmaceutical preparations; computer, electronic, and optical products; aircraft, spacecraft, and
related machinery; and advanced chemical products (Eurostat 2018). Figure 2.6 (panel a) shows the distribu-
tion of ecosystem types based on the relative concentration of firms in high-tech manufacturing in terms of sec-
tor diversity and quality. For comparison, figure 2.6 (panel b) shows the distribution of light manufacturing eco-
systems. In general, high-tech manufacturing requires more specialized knowledge (and know-how) than light
manufacturing and has the potential to produce more sophisticated knowledge spillovers, which are required to
foster innovation in Romania.

Romania has examples of most types of local ecosystems. As the previous figures show, Romania has numer-
ous ecosystems in both light manufacturing and high-tech manufacturing, as well as a number of ecosystems
in digital business services and knowledge-intensive services. The ecosystems across these sectors nearly
cover the gamut of types of local ecosystems, with the exception that no narrow high-potential ecosystems were
observed (table 2.2).

The disproportionate concentration of digital business and knowledge-intensive services firms around large
metropolitan areas highlights the importance of human and knowledge capital, as well as the local market,
as key factors for potential ecosystems. Understanding these factors is important to define policy strategies,
given that not all regions will be able to provide the conditions to improve the attraction of high-quality startups.
At the same time, there might be gains from enhancing the capacity to provide and transfer knowledge to areas
that have emerging or incipient ecosystems, as well as taking on board the challenges and limitations of regions
that do not provide these conditions. These findings do not necessarily mean that counties in which relevant eco-
systems were not identified do not have potential associated with the respective sectors. Rather, it means that
businesses in these ecosystems will likely face additional challenges. Therefore, any policy strategies related to
these counties should aim to connect with and benefit from knowledge in counties with high-potential ecosystems.

       CHARACTERISTICS OF DIGITAL AND TECH
	2.3	 THE
    STARTUPS IN ROMANIA
    To understand the landscape and the challenges of digital and high-tech ecosystems in Romania, the World Bank
    conducted a nationally representative Tech Startup Survey between 2020 and 2021. The survey had six sections:
    (i) basic characteristics of the firm; (ii) founder and management characteristics; (iii) development stage and fund-
    ing; (iv) access to knowledge and network; (v) obstacles to entrepreneurship; and (vi) performance and prospects.

    The World Bank Group Startup Survey used two samples—a tech startup sample and a high-potential sample.
    The tech startup sample focuses on a population of young firms (up to 5 years of age) classified as digital solu-
    tions businesses or high-tech manufacturing firms that are part of the Romanian Business Registry, which cap-
    tures all formally registered active establishments in Romania. The high-potential sample was drawn from two pro-
    prietary databases of notable Romanian startups. This population is a selected group of Romanian startups that
    receives international funding and is captured through web-scraping techniques developed by PitchBook and CB
    Insights. The two firms specialize in identifying businesses that have scaled up using financial instruments that
    are usually associated with high-growth patterns (for example, VC).40 This population of high-potential startups is
    considered an aspirational benchmark in this analysis.

    Triangulating the data from these two populations of firms provides a new perspective on the landscape for
    startups in Romania. The selection of these populations had three main goals. The first was to get the most com-
    prehensive sample of Romanian tech startups to improve the understanding of the entrepreneurial environment
    and identify the specific characteristics and needs of Romanian tech startups focused on the domestic market,
    not all of which have aspirations to growth. The second was to find a group of high-potential startups from Romania
    that have attracted international focus and potentially funding for growth. The third goal was to find the similari-
    ties and differences between the tech startups and the high-potential startups. Because many questions refer to
    the characteristics of the founders and challenges faced by firms at early stages (for example, where the ideas
    and initial financing came from), the comparison can provide interesting insights into differences in the observ-
    able characteristics of entrepreneurs in tech startups and high-potential startups. A closer look at these start-
    ups and their comparison will better inform public policy to foster the entrepreneurship ecosystem in the country.
    (See box 2.3 for more detail on the samples and the rationale for them. Full details on both datasets and the pro-
    cedures used to implement the survey are available in Appendix A.)


        BOX 2.3  Defining and Measuring Tech Startups in Romania
        The definition of startups is controversial and often not rig-       definition of startups by age and another to capture high-po-
        orous. In many circles, including among economists, start-           tential startup firms with the qualitative characteristics that
        ups are defined just as new firms. This definition captures          are often of interest to policy makers.

        young firms—and facilitates the availability of comparable           To capture startup firms with qualitative features of inter-

	2.3.1	 FIRM       CHARACTERISTICS
      Digital (ICT, software, and computer) firms dominate both samples. Most startups in the tech startup sample
      were micro businesses with one or zero employees. A slight majority had no employees, which means that there
      is an important share of self-employment. Most started operation with only zero to one employee. Less than 30
      percent of the firms grew in terms of employment since their establishment. Most startups in the high-potential
      sample are young, digital micro businesses with three or more employees. This contrasts with the tech startup
      sample, in which firms typically had even fewer employees and a high percentage of self-employment. Most start-
      ups in the high-potential sample began their operations with only one to three employees. As intended, firms in
      both samples are mainly in the digital sector (ICT, software, and computers) (figure 2.7).

	2.3.2	 FOUNDER                      AND MANAGEMENT CHARACTERISTICS
     Most startup founders are males under the age of 45. In the tech startup sample, most of the founders’ ages
     are between 28 and 45 years old, with a small high concentration between 35 to 40. In the high-potential sample,
     most founders’ ages are between 25 and 45 years old. In the tech startup sample, around 77 percent of firms have
     one founder, 16 percent of firms have two founders, and less than 7 percent have more than 3 founders. Firms in
     the high-potential sample tended to have more founders: around 80 percent of firms had two or three founders. In
     both samples, there is a large gender gap in founders. In the tech startup sample, 68 percent of firms reported that
     their founders were male, 19 percent reported they were female, and 11 percent did not disclose this information
     (figure 2.8, panel a). Similarly, in the high-potential sample, 75 percent of firms reported that their founders were
     male, 24 percent reported they were female, and 6 percent did not disclose this information (figure 2.8, panel b).

     Founders in the high-potential sample are usually better educated than those in the tech startup sample. Most
     founders in the tech startup sample have college and master’s degrees, 12.7 percent of them do not have a college
     degree, and 2.8 percent have a PhD (figure 2.9, panel a). Most founders of firms in the high-potential sample have
     college and master’s degrees, 16 percent have a PhD and 1 percent do not have a college degree. Women found-
     ers in the high-potential sample usually have higher education than their male counterparts (figure 2.9, panel b).

     Founders in the high-potential sample also usually have more experience abroad than those in the tech start-
     up sample. Thirty-four percent of the managers of firms in the tech startup sample have either worked or stud-
     ied abroad, mostly in other European countries (figure 2.10, panel a). By comparison, 76 percent of founders in
     the high-potential sample have either worked or studied abroad, mostly in the United States (68.8 percent) or in
     European countries (26.2 percent) (figure 2.10, panel b).

     Founders of high-potential startups had more experience in the same sector. That is, firms in the high-potential
     sample were more likely to have both founders with previous experience in the same sector and founders with pre-
     vious experience starting a business. Few of the founders of firms in the tech startup sample had previous expe-
     rience in the same sector of activity of their firms, and most of them (67 percent) had not helped start or started
     another business before they started their current business (figure 2.11, panel a). In contrast, most of the found-
     ers in the high-potential sample had previous experience in the same sector of activity of their startup, and most
     of them (76 percent) had helped start or started another business before they started their new business (figure
     2.11, panel b). Finally, top managers tend to be founders: in both samples, 93–95 percent of the firms report that
     one of the founders is the top manager of the company.

     In contrast to startups in the tech startup sample, those in the high-potential sample are banking on propri-
     etary technology, processes, or procedures to drive short-term growth. Among startups in the high-potential
     sample, the largest fraction (nearly a quarter) have proprietary technology, processes, or procedures and expect
     to grow sales in comparison to 2019 (figure 2.12, panel a). By contrast, more than a quarter of firms in the tech
     startup sample have no proprietary technology and expect that their 2020 sales will remain the same as those
     in 2019 (figure 2.12, panel b). A similar pattern can be observed in terms of employment growth for the next 12

growth in the next year (figure 2.12, panel c). By contrast, most of the startups in the high-potential sample antic-

Firms in both samples expected to grow in the mid-to long-term, but those in the high-potential sample antic-
ipate being acquired. Most firms in the tech startup sample expected that their business would expand in the
next five years, with growth in new markets, at a national level, and abroad (figure 2.13, panel a). Most firms in the
high-potential sample also expected that their business would grow in the next five years, but primarily by expand-
ing into new markets abroad (figure 2.13, panel b). Interestingly, most of the companies in the tech startup sam-
ple expected to stay the same (figure 2.13, panel c), whereas most of those in the high-potential sample expected
to be acquired (figure 2.13, panel d).

Firms in the high-potential sample were more profitable than those in the tech startup sample. In the high-po-
tential sample, 38 percent of firms were already profitable compared to 22 percent of firms in the tech startup firm
sample. Most (63 percent) of the tech startups were unprofitable compared to the high-potential startups sam-
ple (34 percent). Among the companies in both samples that were not yet profitable, most expected to be reve-
nue positive in the next 1 to 2 years.

Startups in the high-potential sample reported more growth than those in the tech startup sample. According
to respondents in the tech startup sample, 35.5 percent of firms experienced flat sales growth in 2020, in com-
parison to the same period in 2019; while 28.8 percent saw an increase, and 14.9 percent a decrease. For those
reporting growth, the typical increase was between 30 percent to 50 percent. Most growth was in digital and
health-related business, as well as retail and wholesale. By contrast, most respondents in the high-potential sam-
ple reported that their sales increased during 2020, in comparison to the same period in 2019. The growth fol-
lowed a similar pattern as for firms in the tech startup sample, concentrating mostly on digital business, health
services and retail/wholesale. The typical increase was between 50 and 100 percent.

High-potential startups with proprietary technology tend to have better-educated founders and are more
likely to be profitable. Most of the founders of profitable tech startups have college degrees, whereas most of
the founders of profitable high-potential startups have MBAs or other master’s degrees. Another crucial differ-
ence is that high-potential startups with propriety technology are more likely to be profitable—among high-poten-
tial startups with proprietary technology, 38.2 percent were profitable, whereas only 22.4 percent of tech start-
ups with proprietary technology were profitable (figure 2.14). Having propriety technology therefore seems to play
a more important role in the profitability of high-potential startups than it does in the profitability of tech startups.

	2.4.2	INNOVATION

    Most tech startups do not consider themselves innovative. Among the firms in the tech startup sample, 67.5 per-
    cent did not consider themselves innovative. Some 21.4 percent reported developing an innovation ever, and
    12.5 percent expected to do it in the future. Less than 20 percent were developing a new-to-market technology
    or processes in national or international markets. (figure 2.15, panel a). Most of the firms that are innovating are
    providing innovative products or technology; some are also innovating business models (figure 2.15, panel b).
    Twenty-six percent of these firms had applied for a patent, copyright or trademark, and 39 percent of firms are
    planning to do so. This could potentially be an indicator of limited knowledge creation and innovation, or limited
    awareness of the IP systems.

    By contrast, all high-potential startups considered themselves innovative. All the high-potential startups con-
    sidered themselves innovative. Seventy-three percent reported new-to-market technology in international mar-
    kets, and 20 percent in national markets. (figure 2.15, panel c). Most of these firms are providing mainly innova-
    tive products rather than technologies or business models (figure 2.15, panel d). Moreover, around 40 percent of
    startups in the high-potential sample reported that they had developed proprietary technology, processes, or pro-
    cedures that no other company can use, and 30 percent are planning to do so. Also, 27 percent of them reported
    that they had applied for a patent, copyright, or trademark, and 50 percent of them are planning to do so. Thus,
    startups in the high-potential sample are more inclined to generate new products or processes, and they could
    be relatively more aware about IP systems.

    Nevertheless, most of the startups in the tech startup and high-potential samples identified themselves as
    technology firms. Seventy percent of the firms in the tech startup sample use or provide services associated
    with the use of new digital technologies, and the remaining 30 percent are more traditional companies that do
    not consider technology to be a core component of their businesses and do not embrace digital transformation.41



    41. It is important to recall that the sample of startups surveyed focuses on digital and knowledge-intensive industries.

     One-half of the tech startups provided customers with digital solutions, such as software development (50 per-
     cent), digital platforms (27.9 percent), or hardware development (17.0 percent) (figure 2.16, panel a). In contrast,
     93 percent of firms in the high-potential sample use or provide services associated with the use of new digital
     technologies. Also, 94 percent of these firms provided digital solutions to customers. Like the tech startups, the
     high-potential startups mainly provide software solutions (60 percent), digital platforms (23.8 percent), and other
     services (11.4 percent) (figure 2.16, panel b).

     In terms of technology use (that is, input-based rather than output-based technology), the majority of tech-
     nology use is related to business administration, marketing and sales. Among firms in the tech startup sample,
     28.1 percent use cloud computing for business purposes, 25.1 percent use the Internet of Things, and 16.9 percent
     use enterprise resource planning (figure 2.17). Big data analytics and artificial intelligence were not widely used.

	2.5	 DIGITAL                AND HIGH-TECH ECOSYSTEM PILLARS
     The digital and high-tech ecosystem is the entrepreneurship ecosystem focused on the digital and high-tech
     sectors. In other words, it is the entrepreneurship ecosystem in which tech startups and high-potential startups
     operate. To support tech startups and high-tech startups, therefore, it is necessary to understand the characteris-
     tics of the digital and high-tech ecosystem in Romania and, in particular, how well it supplies the factors that form
     the three pillars of an entrepreneurship ecosystem: supply, demand, and allocation. This can be accomplished
     using data from the World Bank Romania Startup Survey that we have been discussing.


	2.5.1	 ACCESS          TO KNOWLEDGE, INFORMATION, AND IDEAS
     Startups in the high-potential sample receive more formal support from incubators or accelerators (and thus,
     more mentorship) than startups in the tech startup sample do. Most respondents in the tech startup sam-
     ple reported that they did not receive the support of an incubator or accelerator training program, nor that of a

government program (figure 2.18, panel a). In the high-potential sample, 72 percent of startups did receive sup-
port from an incubator or accelerator training program, which typically included dedicated mentorship programs
for entrepreneurs, although fewer received support from government programs (figure 2.18, panel b). It is not
possible to determine whether the other 28 percent did not get support from incubators or accelerators due to a
lack of demand or a lack of supply. However, given the gaps identified in section 1.4, it must be suspected that a
lack of supply of “supporting” infrastructure is the bigger issue.

Tech startups seek informal advice. The existence of demand for business support is further evidenced by the
fact that firms report seeking information about investment decisions, such as the acquisition of new machines,
equipment, or software. However, the primary sources of such advice for firms in the tech startup sample are not
institutionalized and are usually spontaneous: this includes suppliers and buyers, as well as trade fairs, events,
and other firms (figure 2.19). Firms in the tech startup
sample use business associations, incubators, accel-
erators, public agencies, or universities comparatively FIGURE 2.19  Source of Information for

Relatively few startups in the tech startup sample are engaged in the commercialization of academic research.
Most founders of firms in the tech startup sample report that the inspiration for starting a new business came
from previous work activity, and significant number report that it was related to a hobby or a recreational past
time (figure 2.20, panel a).

In contrast, the high-potential startups were about twice as likely to originate from academic research.
Startup founders in the high-potential sample also often gained their inspiration from their previous work activity.
Compared with the tech startups, they were less likely to report gaining their inspiration from a hobby and more
likely to report gaining inspiration from a team member (figure 2.20, panel b).

     The average time that it took a business to move from an idea to an initial design or prototype was between 1 and
     12 months, regardless of whether the business was a tech startup or a high-potential startup. From initial design
     or prototype to a complete design or prototype took from 1 to 6 months according to firms in both samples. Similarly,
     the respondents in both samples estimated that to move from the product/service being completed to being ready
     to sell took around 1–6 months. The respondents in both samples indicated that it took approximately 5–6 months
     to have stable revenue (from the first time they had revenue), and in a few cases it could take more than 12 months.



	2.5.2	 ACCESS          TO MARKETS
     Most firms in the tech startup sample think of the Romanian national market first. The bulk of firms in the tech
     startup sample (51.3 percent) focus on the national market, followed by local markets (32.1 percent), while the
     rest focus on international markets, with a preference to do business beyond the EU (20.8 percent). By contrast,
     most firms in the high-potential sample think of the international markets (defined as beyond the EU) first (81.7
     percent), followed by national markets (11.5 percent), and the EU (6.7 percent). It is important to recall that these
     categories are not exclusive: firms do focus on national and international markets at the same time (figure 2.21).

     Few firms in the tech startup sample target the business-to-government (B2G) market. Most tech startups
     focused on the business-to-business (B2B) (57 percent) and B2C (49 percent) markets (figure 2.22, panel a). A
     small share of firms (2 percent) target the B2G market, which indicates untapped potential, including for public
     procurement. By contrast, most firms in the high-potential sample (figure 2.22, panel b) are focused on the B2B
     (71 percent) or B2C (29 percent) markets, and none target the B2G market. Like the previous case, these cate-
     gories are not exclusive. Startups that focused on B2B solutions could focus on B2C solutions too.

	2.5.3	 ACCESS         TO FINANCE: DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND FUNDING
     Personal savings or resources are the main source of funding for the initial development stages of startups in both
     samples, although some startups in the high-potential sample have angel investment or VC. (See figure 2.23, pan-
     els a & b). Angel investment and VC are funding sources for startups in the high-potential sample only. This depend-
     ence on personal resources underscores what was noted in chapter 1 regarding the lack of access to finance: it is
     likely to be a significant impediment to the development of the ecosystem because, if personal savings are seen as a
     requirement, entrepreneurial activity will be restricted to individuals with sufficient personal resources.

     Startups in the high-potential sample typically expected to use VC for subsequent growth. In the tech startup
     sample, most of the funding after the initial stage was expected to continue to come from personal resources. In
     contrast, in the high-potential sample, most of the funding after the initial stage was expected to come from angel
     investors and VCs and, to a smaller degree, from personal resources (figure 2.23, panels c & d).

     Accessing loans is a problem for startups in both samples. A vast majority of firms said that over the last three
     years they have not received a loan for purchasing machines or equipment or licensing software. Half of the firms
     said that they had attempted to borrow money to expand production at least 9 times over the last three years but
     could not get a loan. However, the other half did not ask to borrow money to expand production.



	2.5.4	 NETWORK              AND CULTURE
     Entrepreneurs’ social networks are important. Respondents from both samples reported that personal and family ties
     were very important for accessing support (tech startup sample: 61.6 percent; high-potential sample: 44.8 percent).
     They also reported that local business links (tech startup sample: 41.6 percent; high-potential sample: 46.67 percent)
     were important. This underscores the commentary made in section 1.4 regarding the importance of social capital.

     Startups in the high-potential sample also indicated that transnational and regional networks are very impor-
     tant for them. Forty percent of the firms have business (as a supplier or as buyer) with a multinational firm. Also,
     they pointed out that founder´s alumni networks are moderately relevant for them, although they are less impor-
     tant if the alumni network is abroad, which contrasts with the previous responses.

     By contrast, startups in the tech startup sample see some networks as offering little value at present. Re-
     spondents reported that links to public officials are not relevant, and that college alumni networks did not add
     value, especially if the alumni network was abroad. Diaspora networks, other transnational networks, and region-
     al networks were typically seen as unimportant or adding little value. This may be because most of these start-
     ups think of the Romanian national market first.



	2.5.5	 PERCEIVED                OBSTACLES FOR STARTUPS
     The two biggest obstacles for entrepreneurship reported by startups in both samples were business regula-
     tions and the lack of an entrepreneurial mindset. (See figure 2.24.) Regulations, which were identified as an
     issue in every Romanian region, included labor regulations and administrative issues such as permits and taxes.

    In addition, respondents identified that the lack of collaboration among actors could also be an obstacle, which
    means that entrepreneurship ecosystems have poor internal connections. Respondents reported existing techno-
    logical or technical knowledge—as well as infrastructure quality and managerial capabilities—as generally favorable.

    The survey data relates to qualitative perceptions and should be interpreted cautiously. Although it may be
    helpful in determining relative priorities for entrepreneurs, it should not be interpreted as suggesting that the other
    factors do not need to be improved, especially because it is unclear whether respondents calibrated their expec-
    tations with regards to Romania or with regards to other ecosystems. For example, it is surprising that the partici-
    pants in the tech startup sample identified that access to finance is favorable, especially since the same respond-
    ents also reported that they typically relied on their own funding to start a business.




       CONNECTEDNESS OF DIGITAL
	2.6	THE
    AND HIGH-TECH STARTUP ECOSYSTEMS
    Human networks (community) are a critical element of entrepreneurship ecosystems. They support the iden-
    tification of entrepreneurial opportunities, access to finance, access to information, the creation of resources and
    spillovers, strategic alliances, and status signaling. The social networks of an entrepreneurship ecosystem con-
    nect all other elements so entrepreneurs can access the resources needed to create startups.

    The connectedness of an ecosystem refers to the interdependencies and interactions among its constituting
    actors (founders, universities, accelerators, and others). These interactions are key to explain why one ecosys-
    tem outperforms another because when highly connected entrepreneurial actors can access or transmit ideas
    and other forms of knowledge within networks of relationships, spillovers can occur. Also, highly connected enti-
    ties enhance innovation and learning, and facilitate entrepreneurship (Scott, Hughes, and Ribeiro-Sioriano 2021).

    The connectedness of ecosystems plays a key role in determining their strength. The conceptual importance of con-
    nectedness in ecosystems is supported by significant prior research and theoretical models. Previous works on using
    network measures for social capital in entrepreneurship ecosystem assessments include the Startup Genome “Global
    Startup Ecosystem Report 2018” (Startup Ecosystem 2018), the Endeavor Insights 2014 report on “The Power of En-
    trepreneur Networks” (Endeavor Insights 2014), and the 2018 World Bank Group–Global Entrepreneurship Research
    Network (GERN) Ecosystem Connections Mapping.42

    The connectedness analysis has three goals. The first is to identify key players in the ecosystem, that is, those
    that can have the most influence if targeted by interventions. The second is to identify clusters43 in the ecosys-
    tem and their structure, coverage, and trends, such as investments, knowledge sharing, and so on. The third is to
    identify the interdependencies between apparently isolated local ecosystems.

    Understanding and measuring connectedness among actors in the ecosystem can improve policy making.
    The conceptual framework described at the beginning of this report allows us to link social capital and connect-
    edness measures to policies and institutions through the implicit interactions between the policy layer and the
    ecosystem pillars. Understanding the locations and structure of ecosystem connections and clusters allows poli-
    cymakers to better structure their programs. In particular, information about connectedness makes it possible to
    set policy targets based on clusters with high-potential ecosystems rather than traditional geographical jurisdic-
    tions, which may be a more efficient way of targeting funds.

    The high-potential sample of the World Bank Group Romanian Startup Survey included several questions to
    identify the relations between the entities that are part of the Romanian entrepreneurship ecosystem and
    their respective locations. The startups were asked where their founders had studied, who were their investors
    or who had offered them financial support, which accelerators or incubators had supported them, who were the

After universities, accelerators and incubators are the second most important group of players in the ecosys-
tem. The most relevant accelerators and incubators in the ecosystem are InnovX (an EU accelerator), TechAccelerator
(an international accelerator) and StepFWD (a pre-accelerator program). It is important to recall that these find-
ings are not comprehensive, because they are based on the answers given by the surveyed startups.

Universities, accelerators, and incubators are key because of their positions in the network. These entities are key
to facilitating the connections and exchanges of knowledge and know-how in Romania. They usually hold more informa-
tion and can instantly connect and spread information with the wider network. Interventions in central entities could
generate positive externalities for the whole national ecosystem. (Appendix E has a list that identifies each entity.)

The analysis showed that only one central entity provides funding. GapMinder VC was the only key player in the
ecosystem that provides funding. This is unusual, although it perhaps reflects the relatively undeveloped state of
VC in Romania, as well as the fact that, as reported in earlier chapters, most entrepreneurs tend to use personal
savings rather than debt or equity.

The cluster analysis shows that there are seven distinctive clusters in the Romanian startup ecosystem and fourteen
isolated entities. (See figure 2.26) Most of the main clusters are linked to specific universities or accelerators, which is
expected (figure 2.27). Universities and accelerators are key providers of social capital, and previous studies (Mulas and
Gastelu-Iturri 2016; Mulas et al. 2021) have shown that most successful startups are usually associated (through their

  monly associated with international (and experienced) accelerators. Although this study does not use specific metrics
  for startup ‘success,’ the most important clusters are associated with entities that follow previously explained patterns.

  The data reinforces the importance of the Bucharest-Ilfov ecosystem for Romania, with few entrepreneurship
  support structures outside of the main hubs. Including a geographic dimension in the network (by geo-localizing
  all the entities) shows that the most predominant connections are between Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara, and
  Constanta (figure 2.28). These local ecosystems rely on each other, mostly in terms of human and social capital

and finance. However, most of the local startups relate to Bucharest’s universities, accelerators, and funders. The
data also show that firms rely little on their local ecosystems, with the exceptions of Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca.
Therefore, improving the Bucharest ecosystem could generate important externalities to other local ecosystems
in the country, regardless of their economic activity. Additionally, more attention to all other regions is needed to
strengthen ecosystem support structures across Romania.

Most of the international connections of Romanian startups are linked to the United States and the United
Kingdom. Usually, these connections are with foreign universities or investors. However, this connectedness is
minimal in comparison to the domestic connections. (Less than 10 percent of total connections are international.)
These international connections are key for the success of startups, mainly because this kind of connectedness
is relevant for improving human and social capital, as well as a achieving a better understanding of larger mar-
kets and building trust with international actors.

        KEY QUESTIONS
        Chapter 3 assesses the support for entrepreneurship and innovation in Romania. The first part of the
        chapter focuses on public programs supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. It examines the offer of
        50 public programs, the resources allocated to them, and the consistency of this policy mix with policy pri-
        orities. The functional analysis assesses how well these public programs are managed across 27 dimen-
        sions associated with best practices in design, implementation, and governance. The second part of the
        chapter focuses on mapping and describing the services and resources provided by ecosystem enablers,
        that is, non-government institutions supporting entrepreneurship and startups in Romania.

        This chapter aims to address the following questions:

        •	What is the current policy mix of public programs for entrepreneurship and innovation?

        •	Are the public programs targeting innovative and high-growth entrepreneurship in Romania?

        •	Are the public programs following best practices in design, implementation, and governance?

        •	Who oversees public programs for entrepreneurship and innovation?

        •	What are the characteristics of entrepreneurship ecosystem enablers in Romania, and how are they
          allocating resources to support entrepreneurship?




    Programs, policies, and institutions that provide support for entrepreneurship and MSMEs can play a cru-
    cial role in enhancing an entrepreneurship ecosystem. A key component of an entrepreneurship ecosystem is
    the interaction between entrepreneurs, firms, and support programs run by governments and ecosystem ena-
    blers. These programs vary in nature and may target different factors of an ecosystem, ranging from infrastruc-
    ture through financing and regulations to human capital. Additionally, institutions often have different objectives
    and may compete for resources and beneficiaries. Poorly designed public programs can displace or inhibit pri-
    vate initiative and innovation. Thus, it is important to understand both the public programs and those of the eco-
    system enablers that are operating in an ecosystem.



	3.1	 PUBLIC             PROGRAMS
    The mapping exercise, which was conducted in collaboration with government agencies, identified 50 public
    programs supporting science, technology, and innovation (STI) and entrepreneurship during 2014–20. The
    initial stage of the review was to compile a list of relevant programs involving public resources; this list explicitly
    included subnational (regional), national, and supra-national (European Commission) programs,44 provided that
    the program was at least partially administered within Romania and the recipients themselves were in Romania.
    This section examines the overall portfolio of 50 programs, including their estimated budget allocations, objec-
    tives, types of intervention, beneficiaries and so on. The analysis also assesses the functionality and governance
    of selected Romanian STI support programs (the “functional analysis”).

    The total budget allocation for these programs was over €3.6 billion. The total budget allocation came mostly
    from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and national funds. Many of these programs span mul-
    tiple years; if one normalizes these by year, then the estimated budget allocation for all 50 programs is around


    44. The mapping exercise did not include the programs of the EIF because the relevant program information was not available. This is also due
    to the fact that some of the programs were managed by third parties, making it difficult to understand how much of the funding was dedicated
    towards which objectives and target beneficiaries. However, according to the EIF website, since 2008, the EIF has committed over €2 billion,
    composed of €1.8 billion in guarantees and funded instruments, €206 million in equity, and €123 million in microfinance and social entrepre-
    neurship. The instruments of the EIF typically also target ecosystem enablers such as incubators and accelerators, which are usually not tar-
    geted by national public support programs.
     CHAPTER 3  Supporting Entrepreneurship Systems                                                                                                        80




     €577 million per annum. This figure assumes that all programs are operating simultaneously, which reasonably
     reflects the period of 2019-2020, and have budgets spread evenly across time.

     However, absorption of funds is low. For several reasons, including a lack of suitable institutional capacity at various
     levels, Romania usually spends only a portion of the allocated funds. Using data from October 2020, this absorption was
     only 34.7% for programs administered by the Human Capital Program (Programul Operațional Capital Uman, POCU),
     31.8 percent for the Regional Operational Programme (Programul Operațional Regional, POR) and as low as 26.5 per-
     cent for the Competitiveness Operational Programme (Programul Operațional Competitivitate, POC). In what follows, we
     have typically referred to allocated budget as the best indication of public priorities. However, it should be borne in mind
     that the actual expenditure on innovation and entrepreneurship will be much lower because of the low absorption rate.

     Romania lacks a centralized institution to oversee and disburse funding for public instruments. Public pro-
     grams are often implemented by two institutions which contributes to coordination challenges and other adminis-
     trative burdens. It also results in low disbursements of funds, as measured by absorption rates discussed above.



	3.1.1	 ENTREPRENEURSHIP                              AS A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
     About one-quarter of the STI programs had a primary focus on entrepreneurship. The programs identified by this
     research were grouped into four broad categories based on the stated ultimate objective of the program: (1) entre-
     preneurship, (2) innovation and competitiveness, (3) digitalization, and (4) research and development (R&D).45 Of
     the 50 programs, 13 primarily targeted entrepreneurship, 11 primarily targeted digitalization, 12 primarily targeted
     innovation and competitiveness, and 10 primarily targeted R&D (figure 3.1). There was some overlap among the
     programs: of the 11 programs targeting digitalization, two also targeted R&D, and two also targeted innovation
     and competitiveness. In addition, eight programs did not fall into any of the four categories. Although only a minor-
     ity of these programs were specifically focused on entrepreneurship, the remainder addressed areas that were
     potentially of indirect relevance to entrepreneurship—such as supporting the broader ecosystem—or were other-
     wise relevant to startups as well as established firms, and so are included here as part of the broader “policy mix.”

     45. Classifying the programs into the four categories allows differentiating them in terms of target beneficiaries and type of support provided.
     Although all four categories are directly or indirectly relevant for startups and scaleups, the rationale was to better understand the main objec-
     tives of the programs, which clarify the mechanisms (that is, type of support) by which startups and scaleup might have been supported.
     Programs categorized in (1) entrepreneurship typically target new or younger firms, whereas programs in (2) innovation and competitiveness are
     typically more inclusive of all firm sizes and provide support more on the product innovation side. Programs under (3) digitalization typically pro-
     vide support for the acquisition of digital equipment and focus more on the process innovation side. Programs under (4) R&D typically focus on
     earlier stages of research, development, and innovation. That is, while the innovation and competitiveness category focuses on later stages of
     (product) innovation, the R&D category focuses on the earlier stages of innovation. However, there is a degree of overlap between the catego-
     ries, and some programs have multiple objectives that fit in more than one of these categories.
     CHAPTER 3  Supporting Entrepreneurship Systems                                                                               81




     A little over one-quarter of the total STI budget allocation (€949 million total over the period) was allocated
     to entrepreneurship-related programs. Annual budget allocation can thus be estimated at €144 million, that is,
     around one quarter of the estimated annual budget allocation for all 50 programs (€577 million).

     Most of the budget is concentrated in a few large programs. The three largest programs—one under the State
     Aid Program for Financing Investment Projects (Programul Ajutoare de Stat Pentru Finanţarea Proiectelor Pentru
     Investiţii) and two under the Regional Operational Program (Programul Operațional Regional)—account for half of
     this annualized budget, and roughly a quarter of the programs receive three-quarters of the total estimated budget
     allocation. The remaining 75 percent of the programs share one quarter of the budget between them, and more
     than half the programs in the set involved less than €5 million average estimated allocation. This raises the ques-
     tion whether they have the scale necessary to achieve impact (even if they are well designed and implemented),
     or whether the administrative effort for such programs is disproportionately burdensome.



	3.1.2	 ENTREPRENEURSHIP                         AS A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE
     If one reclassifies programs according to more specific objectives—that is to say, detailed activities that are
     incentivized or supported—a slightly different picture emerges. The policy mix in the previous section is based
     on the stated ultimate objectives of the programs. However, some of the “entrepreneurship-related” activities are
     broad and include such things as improving access to finance or promoting technology diffusion. Moreover, some
     non-entrepreneurship instruments may benefit entrepreneurs. As an example, a “digitalization” program might be
     suitable for start-ups developing new digital technologies. In some cases, detailed activities can be considered
     intermediary routes by which a general objective is to be achieved. For example, a program might have as its goal
     improving competitiveness and approach it via improving management practices.

     Many of the “entrepreneurship” programs within the policy mix are dedicated to improving the supporting con-
     ditions or ecosystem. Figure 3.2 shows the policy mix of 50 programs reclassified by specific objectives. Under
     this reclassification, only interventions that support individual entrepreneurs, rather than the ecosystem or other
     adjacent activities, are considered “entrepreneurship” instruments. Using this stricter definition, 17 programs of
     the set of 50 are directly targeted at entrepreneurship.

     However, most of the entrepreneurship-related programs include several specific objectives. Only two of these
     programs were focused solely on entrepreneurship (with an associated budget of €7.5 million); the remaining 15
     were targeted at entrepreneurship together with one or more other target areas (with the budget for dual objective
     instruments totaling €8.5 million; triple-objective instruments €35 million and those with four or more objectives
CHAPTER 3  Supporting Entrepreneurship Systems                                                                                                 82




totaling €3.5 million).46 This is a feature of the policy mix as a whole and suggests that there may be lack of clarity in the
design of some programs, leading to a lack of focus. In turn, this raises questions about the potential effectiveness of the
policy mix, and whether there may be opportunities to improve effectiveness through more specific, dedicated programs.

The proportion of annual budget allocation on STI programs that is focused on direct support for entrepreneur-
ship is closer to 10 percent. The annual budget allocation on specific, entrepreneurship-focused programs is €55
million (figure 3.3), which is about 9.5 percent of the €577 million per estimated annual budget allocation for all
50 programs. Very few programs—with little associated budget—address management practices, linkages with for-
eign firms, market access, or export promotion. These are potential gaps that may inhibit the technology adoption
and scaling of Romanian MSMEs, especially given the weaknesses identified in chapter 1. Within the access to
finance category, there is a preference for more established firms: the total budget of instruments available to mature
firms to support access to finance is approximately 40 percent greater than those available for firms at seed stage.

Most funding goes to the infrastructure and access to finance factors of the entrepreneurship ecosystem. Figure
3.4 groups the estimated budget allocation by the ecosystem factors described in the conceptual framework of this
report. Not all factors receive the same support. There is significant funding devoted to physical capital and infra-
structure, and several programs with moderate funding are devoted to access to finance. However, few programs
and relatively little funding are devoted to efforts to improve human capital47 or market access.48 Although the reg-
ulatory environment is one of the ecosystem factors, it is not reflected in figure 3.4 because regulatory improve-
ments would not typically take the form of such instruments. Within the access to finance category, there is a pref-
erence for more established firms: the total budget of the access to finance instruments available to mature firms
is around 40 percent greater than the total budget of instruments that are available to firms at the seed stage.

46. Note: where an instrument specified multiple objectives, it was assumed that the budget was split equally across these objectives.
47. Because the public support programs typically do not treat the ecosystem factors “firm capabilities” and “entrepreneurial characteristics”
separately, one can assume that the objectives related to these factors are grouped under human capital.
48. The categorization by specific objective allowed for instruments to target multiple objectives, with the budget of the instrument being spread
accordingly. The categorization by ecosystem factor allocated each instrument to a single pillar.

	3.1.3	 SUPPORT               BY BENEFICIARY TYPE
     Direct support to entrepreneurs and enabling organizations is limited. The direct beneficiaries of the set of 50
     STI programs are the types of organizations or individuals who were eligible to receive support. Direct support for
     entrepreneurs or prospective entrepreneurs (as opposed to young firms) is very limited in both number and budget
     (figure 3.5); this illustrates a lack of ‘pre-startup’ support. Support for ecosystem enablers such as accelerators,
     incubators, and business associations are also relatively limited, with both a relatively low number of programs
     and a relatively small overall budget directed towards them.

     Programs were poorly targeted at startups, in terms of catering to their size, profitability, technology read-
     iness levels, and so on. For example, among the programs that focused on the private sector, many simultane-
     ously targeted several firm sizes and life cycles, with little specialization (figure 3.6, panels a & b). Experience indi-
     cates that each of these business activity segments requires special skills to serve them; even firms at different
     startup phases have different needs (Marcon and Ribeiro 2021). Thus, the policies needed to support high-po-
     tential startups (such as small startups with high-growth ambitions working in emerging technology) may be very
     different from the policies needed to support established SMEs. Small support programs with wide-ranging offer-
     ings are highly unlikely to have the capabilities required. Policymakers therefore need to differentiate between
     startups and other firms, including other SMEs. As described in the introduction, startups may be considered a
     special subset of SMEs. Among other differences, their capacity building and financing needs differ from those
     of established SMEs. Tech startups and high-potential startups, in turn, are special subsets of startups, and also
     require specialized attention.

     Several entrepreneurship programs are available only to firms that are already profitable. The private equity
     and VC industries exist largely because some high-potential startups that are ultimately very profitable undergo
     considerable pre-revenue periods during which they are focused on growth and user adoption. Excluding these
     high-potential startups from eligibility is therefore likely to forego some of the benefits of having successful high-po-
     tential startups in an ecosystem.

     Programs are generally risk averse. In addition to a focus on profitable firms, many programs specifically target
     mature firms (figure 3.6, panels c & d) and market-ready technologies. This indicates a general risk-aversion, with
     instruments directed towards ‘safer’ options. Although public bodies must be cautious with public funds, it should
     be understood that a supportive innovation ecosystem needs to assist technology development across the spec-
     trum of technology readiness, from the laboratory to the market, and that innovation and entrepreneurship always
     entail risks. Therefore, the portfolio of support instruments should not seek to minimise risk, but rather should
     aim to manage it, with an appropriate understanding of the nature of start-ups and new technology.

      technology.
      a. Micro: 0–9 employees; small: 10–49 employees; medium: 50–249 employees; large: 250 or more employees.
      b. Firm stages were defined as follows: “Seed” refers to an innovation or business venture in its initial stage, not yet registered officially as a business;
      “Startup” refers to enterprises typically under 5 years old where an idea already has gone through prototyping or is in the pre-commercial/commercial
      stages; “Scale-up” refers to the stage where an idea is already commercialized and is being scaled up for growth and expansion, often requiring
      financing by debt or equity; “Mature” refers to firms that have reached post-expansion/post-growth stages and are in their consolidation phase.



	3.1.4	 INTERVENTION                           MECHANISMS
      In the STI policy mix as a whole—not just the subset of entrepreneurship-related programs—grants are the
      dominant intervention mechanism, both by number and by value. In fact, nearly all programs examined by this
      exercise (43 of 50) used grants or matching grants as the preferred mechanism of intervention (figure 3.7, panel
      a). Grants received nearly three times as much budget as any other intervention mechanism (figure 3.7, panel b).

      Grants are comparatively straightforward to administer but are not sufficient in themselves. Some factors
      affecting entrepreneurial activity—such as mindset, culture, or regulatory burden—may not be easily changed or
      resolved by the addition of public funds, so grant-making should not be considered a substitute for wider reform.
      In addition, public funding can sometimes have a distortionary effect on private markets. However, given the over-
      all stage of development of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Romania, any distortionary effect of the current
      grants is likely to be minimal. Further, there are sound economic reasons why it may be appropriate to use grants
      to incentivize activities that have positive externalities (such as R&D). This section should not therefore be inter-
      preted as suggesting that current grant funding is sufficient.

     A significant share of resources is being applied towards technology adoption. Figure 3.8 maps the pub-
     licly funded entrepreneurial support landscape by distributing the resources allocated across two dimensions:
     (1) the type of support (indirect financial support, direct financial support, and direct non-financial support) and
     (2) the objective (innovation versus technology adoption). As can be seen from the chart, there are slightly greater
     resources devoted to instruments which support technology adoption than creation. Moreover, echoing the image
     above, the chart below also shows that the bulk of resources are provided in the form of direct financial support.

	3.1.5	 FUNCTIONAL                                ANALYSIS
     This section examines the functionality of public programs—the quality of the processes involved in creating
     and implementing each program. Aspects of functionality include design, implementation, monitoring and eval-
     uation systems, human resources, and governance (the program’s integration and interactions with other pro-
     grams, institutions, and regulations). This functional analysis complements the analysis of the policy mix discussed
CHAPTER 3  Supporting Entrepreneurship Systems                                                                         86




in the sections above and enables providing evidence-based recommendations for improving the design, imple-
mentation, and governance of programs. It is explicitly not an impact evaluation, nor a performance evaluation of
the program managers’ competences.

The functional analysis was undertaken by means of structured interviews using an assessment framework
benchmarked to international best practices. The analysis aims to reveal whether key elements of effective
innovation policies are in place in three key areas: design, implementation, and governance. The assessment
framework, developed by the World Bank, scored support programs on a total of 31 variables (14 related to pro-
gram design, 12 related to implementation, and 4 related to program governance) as shown in figure 3.9. Multiple
reviewers were used to reduce bias. This research component did not cover the entire set of 50 STI programs but
a smaller subset of 9 programs that were more closely focused on entrepreneurship.

  Monitoring & evaluation design

Program design refers to the rationale for and design of each program, including such aspects as its con-
tribution to higher-level objectives, its justification, the logic behind it, and its suitability for monitoring and
evaluation. Public interventions must be designed through a process covered by the rule of law and consistent
with general national or regional goals for research and innovation. They must be properly justified and address
real problems, avoiding the trap of addressing false failures. This justification can also help avoid capture of pub-
lic resources by certain vested beneficiaries. Once a system failure is identified, policy makers should consider
the full range of alternative intervention designs rather than simply copying existing programs. By design, inter-
ventions should follow a logic model with a clear, well-articulated theory of change, which helps depict the shared
relationships and causal linkages between program inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes and logically con-
nects them to higher-level strategic objectives. Logic models should define indicators for inputs, activities, out-
puts, and outcomes that allow for monitoring and evaluation of program performance.

Program implementation refers to the processes for administering a program, including the application,
selection, and reporting processes. These should be clear and transparent, and knowledge management sys-
tems should be in place to allow for systematic learning and improvement of the program during implementation.
Implementing agencies must have adequate workforce and organizational structures to administer the program,
CHAPTER 3  Supporting Entrepreneurship Systems                                                                                                     87




and staff should have training opportunities and incentives that are relevant to program performance (rather than
generic to public administration staff). Internal and external monitoring and evaluation of the program should take
place, and, critically, evaluation results should be used to improve and adapt the program.

Program governance refers to the interacting effects of programs, institutions, and jurisdictions on the abil-
ity of a program to deliver on its goals. Good practice is for coordination mechanisms to minimize overlap and
enhance complementarities between the program and other programs and agencies. Implementing staff should
also be aware of external laws and regulations that can inhibit the implementation of the program and should be
proactive in taking steps to adapt for optimal operation of the program.



Results of the Functional Analysis

The results of the functional analysis suggest a large variation across dimensions practices associated with
design, implementation, and governance (inter-institutional integration) of the programs. Figure 3.10 shows
the scores across the set of 9 programs, with average scores shown in yellow, and the minimum and maximum
scores for each variable within the set shown in orange and green respectively. A mid-range score of 3 should not
necessarily be interpreted as ‘average’ globally but rather as a functional aspect that is satisfactory but has room
for improvement. The following subsections analyze the results in the three key areas of the assessment frame-
work: program design, implementation, and governance.

Program Design

Program design was the weakest of the three key areas of the assessment framework. Among the design cat-
egories, the use of logic models, accounting for inputs and activities, and the proper identification and measure-
ment of outcomes were particularly lacking.

The analysis found consistent weaknesses in the logic model of entrepreneurship programs, as well as the
models’ inputs and the programs’ budgets, objectives, outcomes and incentives. A well-defined logic model
helps define indicators that allow for monitoring and evaluation of program performance, as well as assisting bet-
ter targeting of programs, and potentially also the choice of intervention mechanisms (as mentioned in the sec-
tion above). The absence of logical framework leads to a lack of connection between outputs and outcomes.

Relatedly, several entrepreneurship programs lacked measurable objectives at the system level. Many pro-
grams specified objectives in terms of project or beneficiary achievements rather than the overall effects of the
program on the innovation system or economy such as jobs, productivity or economic growth. In addition, sev-
eral programs had seemingly been designed without considering alternative models of intervention for the stated
objectives, which would in part explain the dominant

In contrast, the program origins were one of the highest-scoring features of the analysis. This is explained by
the fact that many of the examined entrepreneurship programs were partly funded by the European Commission,
whose operating programs are highly formalized, requiring documentation and good rationales for inclusion of pro-
grams in their funding schemes. This avoids pitfalls related to arbitrary reasoning, imitation, or undue influence in
the creation of new programs. However, it is possible that this formalized origin also affected deeper considera-
tion of some other design features: more than once, interviewees commented that a program had been designed
in a certain way because of the expectations of the co-funder (the European Commission), rather than because
it was the most effective or efficient way to deliver the desired change.



Program Implementation

The analysis found that program implementation and governance was, overall, slightly better than design,
although there was scope for major improvement in most categories. Among the implementation categories,
the areas of greatest concern are (1) application and selection processes, (2) management structures, (3) budg-
ets, (4) the incentives associated with staff performance, and (5) evaluation mechanisms.

Application and selection processes are suboptimal. Many programs had a division of labor in processing appli-
cations, with different roles given to different entities. Different groups might be responsible for financial and
technical assessments, for example. In addition, there was some repetition in verification processes. These fea-
tures are likely to limit timely responses. Furthermore, the analysis also suggested that administrative burdens
for many beneficiaries are high. There has been a significant effort by managing bodies to simplify the applica-
tion processes for support schemes and reduce the bureaucracy for applicants. However, there were still indica-
tions that these processes remain overly complex for applicants and could be further simplified. For example, it
was reported that startups and MSMEs often needed to hire consultants and advisors to apply for government
support schemes; this is an indicator that the application processes are overly complex. This likely deters entre-
preneurs and shifts support away from the most resource-scarce firms with high potential. We emphasise that,
for most start-ups, every activity has a substantial opportunity cost, and hence the ease of application and time-
liness of decisions are essential to building trust in the public support system.

The management structure of programs imposes a burden. Many entrepreneurship programs were structured
in a way that involved both a managing authority (MA) and an intermediary body (IB) working in co-ordination. This
co-ordination was well-practiced, with the division of responsibilities being generally well-defined. However, inter-
views revealed some tensions between these bodies, and, from a management theory perspective, unless care-
fully managed, it is highly likely that this structure introduces additional friction and costs.
    CHAPTER 3  Supporting Entrepreneurship Systems                                                                    89




    Some budgets were mis-sized. There were several examples of entrepreneurship support schemes that were
    substantially oversubscribed, suggesting that there may not have been a good understanding of the potential
    demand in the design of the solicitations.

    The performance assessments of staff—and hence their incentives—were not related to the content of the pro-
    grams. This practice follows, as in other areas, the processes established for public service. Public management
    processes were not monitored for continuous improvement, which is also reflected in its lower average score. In
    addition, some process monitoring scores were low not because of an absence of monitoring, but because of the
    administrative burden that existing monitoring and reporting imposed on staff. It was clear from interviews that this
    constituted a heavy burden in many cases, with perceived duplication of reporting processes in some instances.

    The analysis found significant variation in the evaluation mechanisms. Evaluation mechanisms were relatively
    strong at the ‘priority axis’ level (that is, in terms of having mechanisms to track and monitor the top-level out-
    comes of the wider portfolio of STI programs as a whole). Evaluation mechanisms were also relatively strong at
    the level of individual projects (for example, tracking the outputs of grants to specific start-ups). However, they
    were relatively weaker at the program level (that is, the level needed to determine whether a specific program is
    effectively achieving its goal). Improved evaluation at the program level would also support rationalization of the
    portfolio by providing information about which programs are more effective and potentially should be scaled-up
    and which need to be modified or even abandoned. This may relate to the lack of measurable objectives at the
    system level mentioned above. Again, understanding which programs are effective would also benefit from (and
    support the development of) a deeper theory of change, which would in turn support the development of more
    effective programming in the future.



    Program Governance

    The analysis found relatively good internal and external coordination mechanisms (coordination with programs
    within the agency and with other agencies). This is partly because programs within the European Commission’s
    ‘priority axes’ have some coordination mechanisms built in. However, in some cases those mechanisms could be
    utilized further to provide more strategic perspectives on the related programs. 

    The functional analysis also found several instances of entrepreneurship programs being constrained by
    European State Aid rules. This was primarily due to the State Aid rules not being well-adjusted to the innovation
    support by government interventions. However, these rules are not easy to change, and managers were typically
    aware of these rules and their constraints. 




	3.1.6	SUMMARY

    Overall, Romania has a good base of public programs to build upon in many categories but needs to improve
    the consistency of strong system-wide practices. Examining the variance of scores can reveal categories that
    are consistently strong or weak, as opposed to categories where there are some isolated examples of good prac-
    tice or uneven implementation. The bottom-left quadrant of figure 3.11 illustrates categories that are consistently
    weak. The top left quadrant shows categories with variable weakness; these are categories where there are learn-
    ing opportunities for many programs and some pockets of good practice upon which to build. The top right quad-
    rant illustrates variably strong categories; here, good practice is not uniformly established, but there is a good
    base upon which to build. There are learning opportunities for selected programs. Finally, the bottom right quad-
    rant shows categories which were consistently strong; these are areas where there are already good system-wide
    practices in place, providing learning opportunities for other programs.

	3.2	 ECOSYSTEM                          ENABLERS
      This section focuses on ecosystem enablers, defined as nongovernmental organizations supporting entrepre-
      neurship. In most ecosystems, enablers—including but not limited to community builders, event organizers, incu-
      bators, accelerators, mentors, business angels, and seed and VCs—play a significant role, especially to support
      startups. These programs vary in nature and may support different elements of an entrepreneurship ecosystem,
      ranging from infrastructure through financing and regulations to human capital, to broader ‘ecosystem coordina-
      tion.’ There is evidence, for example, that accelerators have positive spillover effects on the wider business eco-
      system, as well as direct impact on the accelerated startups (Bone et al. 2019). In addition, these programs are
      usually carried out by wide-ranging institutions that often have different governance models and objectives and
      frequently compete for resources and beneficiaries.

      The analysis is based on a preliminary mapping and survey of entrepreneurship ecosystem enablers in Romania
      led by the World Bank. The analysis provides a broad overview of the number and type of enablers in Romania.49
      However, because many of the enablers were of fundamentally distinct types, it was only possible to gain a coarse-
      grained view of them using a single survey instrument. Further research is therefore warranted.



	3.2.1	 MAPPING                    OF ENABLERS IN ROMANIA
      This section examines the characteristics of ecosystem enablers supporting entrepreneurship in Romania.
      The mapping identified a total of 33 enablers supporting entrepreneurship, 27 of which participated in the World
      Bank Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Enablers survey, which is used as the main reference for this analysis.50 The
      services offered by these enablers are meant to complement those offered by public programs. However, given
      the diversity of the programs offered—in terms of their scope, objectives, geographical coverage, and types of


      49. The ecosystem enablers that responded to the survey are among the most actively involved with startup events, conferences and hacka-
      thons and are managing programs or competitions for startups. They are constantly present at ecosystem events. Many offers additional sup-
      port by partnering with other organizations.
      50. Appendix B provides more details about the methodology used to implement the survey.

     beneficiaries—the enablers and the services they provide overlap with public programs or each other, resulting in
     coordination challenges.

     The most typical ecosystem enablers in the sample are private for-profit community builders or event organiz-
     ers. The most common functions of enablers were as community builders or event organizers (14 organizations),
     investors or financial institutions (7 organizations), and accelerators (5) (figure 3.12, panel a). Most were private for-
     profit (20 organizations) and nongovernmental organization non-profit (10 organizations). The Romanian state role
     (public-private partnerships) was very limited (figure 3.12, panel b). International organizations were not identified.

             AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED
	3.2.2	 SERVICES
     BY ECOSYSTEM ENABLERS

     The main objectives reported by these organizations are building the ecosystem and firm scale up, followed
     by helping firms access markets and adopt technology. Supporting formalization, survival, and development of
     workplace skills are among the least reported objectives (figure 3.13, panel a). Interestingly, job creation was not
     widely seen as an expected outcome by many enablers, nor was firm survival. This suggests that, for many eco-
     system enablers, job creation is an outcome that follows firm scaling rather than being the end-goal of the ena-
     blers. Moreover, in high-tech sectors, it is possible for some startups to create significant value without increas-
     ing their staff headcount.

     The top three services provided by ecosystem enablers included strengthening and building collaboration
     networks, management and business training, and access to finance. This underscores the importance of net-
     work density within the startup ecosystems, and reflects comments reported in primary research interviews about
     the need for better ecosystem-wide connections. The next most frequent core service was management and busi-
     ness training; this category may also include mentoring support, which is a common feature of many accelera-
     tors. However, if one considers both core and complementary offers, then market access was delivered more fre-
     quently. Access to finance was the third most common core service. About 19 enablers provided services related
     to strengthening and building collaboration networks, 14 enablers provided managerial and business training
     for new entrepreneurs starting a new business (for example, change of mindset), and 12 provided finance (fig-
     ure 3.13, panel b). This is consistent with the fact that the function of most of the organizations in the sample is
     holding events to build communities, followed by investing and accelerating new ventures. As complementary ser-
     vices, they provide business training for existing firms, support to comply with current regulations and, to a lesser
     extent, support for technology adoption. Most do not provide financial support (19 enablers), and equity finance
     and grants play a small role (figure 3.13, panel c). Most enablers did not expect beneficiaries to pay for the non-fi-
     nancial services that they provide.

    Services demonstrate a partially complementary fit with public programs. Access to finance is a common fea-
    ture of both public programs and ecosystem enablers, underscoring the importance of finance to young startups.
    However, there are some areas where the services provided are noticeably different. For example, if one examines
    ‘non-core’ services as well as core services, assistance with market access and managerial expertise was com-
    monly provided by the ecosystem enablers in the survey; however, these objectives received very limited atten-
    tion from the public programs examined in section 2.1 above.



	3.2.3	 MANAGEMENT                      CHARACTERISTICS OF ECOSYSTEM ENABLERS
    Management characteristics of ecosystem enablers matter because of the critical role they play in entrepre-
    neurship support to innovative firms and startups. High-level assessments on the quality of entrepreneurship
    programming (including staff capabilities) are included in identifying strengths and weaknesses in entrepreneur-
    ship ecosystems. Influence of ecosystem enablers can also extend beyond just unlocking networks and access to
    finance for young firms. Enablers can also influence program outreach, particularly to women entrepreneurs and
    other underserved segments. Similar to understanding individual entrepreneurial characteristics, see Chapter 3,
    this analysis also looks at characteristics of enablers because of their fundamental role for guiding young firms
    and seeks to understand trends that can translate into tangible considerations for policymakers.

    Most of the top managers of ecosystem enablers are the founders, and they have helped to start or owned
    other businesses, with few exceptions. (See figure 3.14, panel a.) These managers tend to have a college edu-
    cation or higher level of education, 14 of them holding a postgraduate degree (figure 3.14, panel b). About a third
    of top managers have spent at least a month abroad pursuing academic objectives (figure 3.14, panel c).

 Note: Total does not necessarily sum to 32 because some enablers have multiple managers.


 Few top managers of ecosystem enablers are women, but they tend to have more experience, be more highly
 educated, and be more likely to have studied abroad. Only six of the top managers in enablers are women (fig-
 ure 3.15, panel a). They tend to be older than male managers (39.9 versus 33.8 years old on average) and have
 more years of experience working in the sector than men (figure 3.15, panel b). Female managers also tend to be
 more likely to have studied abroad (figure 3.15, panel c). The disproportionate distribution across gender in man-
 agerial positions in ecosystem enablers may also reflect potential barriers associated with female entrepreneurs.

	3.2.4	 BENEFICIARIES                    OF ECOSYSTEM ENABLERS
     Ecosystem enablers in Romania target mostly young businesses and tend to either focus on ICT or be sec-
     tor agnostic. About 16 enablers serve businesses between 0 to 3 years of age. About 12 have no target based
     on age, and a minority serve companies 3 years of age or older (figure 3.16, panel a). Half of the enablers focus
     mainly on the digital sector (ICT, software, and computers), 6.7 percent focus on beneficiaries in the education
     sector, and the rest are sector agnostic (figure 3.16, panel b).

     Most ecosystem enablers target firms and individuals as beneficiaries. Twenty-eight enablers provide their servic-
     es to firms (startups), and 27 provide their services to individuals (entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs) (fig-
     ure 3.17). Fewer enablers support research institutions or associations, and very few support cooperatives, financial
     institutions, SOEs, or other government agencies. Female beneficiaries accounted for between 20 and 50 percent
     of direct individual beneficiaries depending on the ena-
     bler. However, the percentage of female applicants to the
     enablers’ programs is not known. Ecosystem enablers’ FIGURE 3.17  Target Beneficiaries by Type

     The enabler survey revealed that accelerator programs are more selective. This is in line with global trends
     because accelerators target “scale up” stage firms and rapidly match them with capital and advisory in order to
     help firms further scale. In contrast, incubators typically support more nascent firms over a longer time horizon.
     In Romania, accelerators admitted around 30 percent of applicants, whereas incubators admitted 85 percent
     of applicants. Other enablers, such as investors and financial institutions, reported supporting around of 25 per-
     cent of applicants.

     Most ecosystem enablers cover both Bucharest and other regions. 25 enablers target Bucharest and other re-
     gions, while 4 target Bucharest exclusively (figure 3.18). Bucharest-Ilfov and North-West have the largest share
     of target beneficiaries. However, Bucharest has the fewest enablers per enterprise. This means that the number
     of enablers in the city does not correspond to the concentration of businesses in it.

     Almost all ecosystem enablers reported following KPIs regularly. About a third (9) of the enablers support-
     ing entrepreneurial activities performed quarterly performance reviews, 8 conducted annual reviews, and 7 con-
     ducted monthly reviews. The vast majority reviewed KPIs at a higher frequency. Firm scale-up and firm creation
     are the top KPIs, with well over half of enablers indicating one of these as their principal KPIs. Follow-up funding
     was another popular indicator, and some enablers used other indicators (figure 3.19, panel a). Nearly all ecosys-
     tem enablers (25 out of 27) collect feedback on a regular basis, and enablers use this feedback to adapt their
     performance as well.

     However, very few ecosystem enablers perform rigorous impact evaluations. Only about 21.7 percent of ena-
     blers completed any kind of impact evaluation to evaluate their success (figure 3.19, panel b). In particular, impact
     evaluation using a control group was rare. The use of a control group to compare with the treatment group is con-
     sidered good practice in generating a higher standard of evidence. Such evaluation is more common within pub-
     lic-sector bodies or not-for-profit organizations (which need to demonstrate their impact to taxpayers or donors).
     However, it can also be valuable to private-sector organizations. For one thing, it helps identify which services may
     CHAPTER 3  Supporting Entrepreneurship Systems                                                                                                      96




     be more impactful than others, enabling the organization to adapt to stay as relevant and useful as possible. It
     can also help make a case for sponsorship or attracting high-quality startups

     Moreover, almost none shared their results publicly. Where evaluations had been undertaken—whether using
     control groups or not—the results were almost never made public. This lack of data transparency makes it dif-
     ficult for entrepreneurs to decide between programs run by ecosystem enablers and evaluate their costs (even
     if only in terms of opportunity cost rather than financial cost). A lack of data also hinders third-party evaluation
     of the ecosystem enablers and makes it difficult for funders and policymakers to determine their effectiveness.

     Many ecosystem enablers need to modernize their processes. Many enablers reported using tools for tracking
     KPIs such as standardized software and digital apps. However, many others reported that they still relied on hand-
     written processes. This suggests a need for modernization.




	3.2.7	 IMPACT         OF COVID-19
     Around 60 percent of the enablers reported being significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak due to the
     reduced demand for existing and new services. Accelerators, community builders, and event organizers were
     most impacted, followed by educational and research institutions and investors or financial institutions (figure
     3.20, panel a). The main impact was a reduction in demand for services, both existing and new (figure 3.20, panel
     b). Many ecosystem enablers reported that mobility restrictions also reduced their ability to serve beneficiaries.

     Despite COVID-19, many ecosystem enablers started or expanded their training and technical support offering
     for digital solutions and managerial and business training. (See figure 3.21, panel a.) Similarly, they kept offer-
     ing access to workspaces, new machinery, and equipment; as well as their support for expanding market access.
     Furthermore, most of the training and technical support provided by Intermediary Organizations (IOs) was asso-
     ciated with digital solutions focused mostly on supply chain management, service delivery, marketing and sales
     (e-commerce), and online and electronic payments (figure 3.21, panel b).

	3.2.8	 PERCEIVED               BARRIERS TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP
     Like entrepreneurs, ecosystem enablers reported that regulations and a lack of entrepreneurial mindset were
     the major barriers to entrepreneurship (See figure 3.22.) Finance and funding opportunities were also seen as
     poor. Enablers also agreed with entrepreneurs and startups that there were generally favorable conditions related
     to quality of infrastructure, qualified and skilled labor, and technical knowledge support services in the country.
     Opinions were mixed as to whether Romania has a favorable environment in terms of collaboration between actors,
     market access, and managerial or business skills.

	3.3	SUMMARY
   Based on these assessments of public programs and ecosystem enablers, it can be concluded that there
   is significant room for improvement when it comes to the capacity of existing institutions responsible for
   entrepreneurship programming. Consistent with analysis discussed in Chapter 1, the creation of a centralized
   agency whose core mission is to further entrepreneurship through targeted interventions will be critical to fur-
   thering Romania’s entrepreneurial aspirations, including providing direct and indirect support to ecosystem ena-
   blers. Startups, although regarded as MSMEs statistically speaking, have completely different aspirations for lev-
   eraging digital technologies to scale their business models and achieve growth. These require targeted policies,
   distinct programs and financing instruments as compared to those for traditional SMEs. Hence, the organizations
   that manage these programs also need to be very different in terms of their governance, staff capabilities, and
   overall agility to work hand-in-hand with ecosystem players, investors, and policy circles. Some characteristics of
   well-functioning entrepreneurship agencies include a clear mission, vision, and values; focused communications
   campaign and clear branding; good governance structure; capable staff (ideally recruited from private sector); and
   a robust M&E system. Romania is possibly the only EU member state that does not have a properly functioning
   innovation or entrepreneurship agency. It loses out in terms of knowledge sharing on innovation/entrepreneurship
   policy making and programming by not being a member of the European Network of Innovation Agencies (TAFTIE),
   which in turn impacts beneficiaries of Romania’s entrepreneurial programs.

RECOMMENDATIONS

   KEY QUESTIONS
   Chapter 4 provides policy recommendations informed by the results of the analytical work
   presented in this report and consultations with key actors of the entrepreneurship ecosys-
   tems in Romania. In brief, more funding needs to be allocated to improve quality and scale-up of
   firms, as well as promote networking and deepening linkages with successful founders, including dias-
   pora entrepreneurs. The chapter provides evidence-driven and stakeholder-driven policy recommenda-
   tions aligned with the pillars of the ecosystem. It also compares our policy recommendations with the Top
   12 policy interventions proposed by the Romanian ecosystem.

   An overview of each policy recommendation is provided in this report. Detailed policy recommendations
   including timeframe, implementation bodies, notional costing, and KPIs can be found in a separate doc-
   ument, Scaling Entrepreneurship in Romania: A Policymaker’s Toolkit.

   This chapter aims to address the following questions:

   •	Is this mix of public programs and ecosystem enablers conducive to supporting quality entrepreneurship?
   •	What are the main gaps in support for the Romanian entrepreneurship ecosystem identified through
     the diagnostic report?

   •	What are the prioritized policy recommendations to support entrepreneurship based on the key find-
     ings of this report and ecosystem stakeholders?




This report presents a comprehensive diagnostic of entrepreneurship performance and pillars of the entrepre-
neurship ecosystem in Romania. The following sections provide (i) evidence-based policy recommendations based
on the report’s findings and analysis and (ii) a comparison of the evidence-based policy recommendations with
the “Top 12” interventions proposed by the Romanian entrepreneurship ecosystem through the Strategic Working
Groups, organized as part of the European Commission-funded “Romania’s Startup Ecosystem Strategy” initiative.

The policy recommendations and prioritization were derived from two mutually reinforcing activities: analy-
sis presented in earlier chapters of this report and from strategy working group sessions with key actors of
the Romanian entrepreneurship ecosystem. They also draw upon the World Bank’s A Practitioner’s Guide to
Innovation Policy (Cirera et al. 2020), a wider review of the literature on the impact of programs to support entrepre-
neurship, and an extensive consultation with key actors of entrepreneurship ecosystems in Romania and abroad.
This diagnostic surfaced 11 evidence-based policy recommendations while the Romanian ecosystem identified
its “Top 12” interventions. The proposed interventions are prioritized by urgency, resource, and cost considera-
tions. The description of the policy interventions includes a short summary of the “main problem”, based on key
findings of the diagnostic. Second, an intervention is proposed, followed by a brief description of the instruments.
The policy recommendations are categorized by:

  •	Policies – refer to legislative/regulatory reforms to create an enabling environment for high growth entrepre-
    neurship to take root and thrive;

  •	Programs – refer to programs that target entrepreneurs, firms, and other ecosystem actors; and

  •	Institutions – refer to governance and entities essential for the entrepreneurship agenda.

The table below illustrates the categorization. It is possible for policy recommendations to span two or three cat-
egories, as indicated by table 4.1 below.

The recommendations are also prioritized in several ways. These recommendations also identify prioritization
(or sequencing), time sensitivity, and “quick wins”51 (table 4.2). Priorities are coded as follows:

   •	 Mission critical refers to activities that are (i) extremely time sensitive since the government is currently
      designing the new programming period which provides an opportunity to embed data-driven and “SMART”
       policy recommendations based; and/or (ii) lay the groundwork for future recommendations. If these rec-
      ommendations are not immediately prioritized, Romanian authorities risk missing its economic objectives.

   •	 Flagship refers to critical activities that should be undertaken to further development of Romania’s emerg-
      ing entrepreneurship ecosystem.

   •	 Foundational long-term refers to critical activities that require a longer time horizon to come to fruition since
      there are other “foundational” elements that need to be sequenced and prioritized first.

Our analysis and interventions identified from the bottom-up strategy development process identified a num-
ber of similar policies, programs, and institutions. The figure below illustrates the overlap between evidence-
and stakeholder-driven policy recommendations. There are two main differences. First, based on an analysis of
public instruments supporting STI and entrepreneurship, our analysis identified an urgent need to recalibrate
the policy mix and improve its functionality. Second, the Romanian ecosystem identified a need to appoint Chief
Technology Officers (CTOs) in government. Although we concur with this recommendation, the authorities need
to prioritize other critical interventions.

  AND (B) IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE

          CRITICAL                SENSITIVE                WIN                   NEEDED




          RATIONALE 
         As discussed in Chapter 3 of this Report, Romania’s current policy mix for STI and entrepreneurship is
         not optimized for firms at the earliest stages and entrepreneurs, nor does it address the quality of firms
         at entry and the limited number of high-growth firms in the ecosystem. Romania hovers at round 3 per-
         cent of high-growth firms compared to 11.4 percent in peer countries. This reflects policymakers’ limited
         understanding of how startups differ from SMEs because many instruments target post-revenue firms.

         Our functional analysis of existing support programs reveals that:
           •	Many instruments are under-disbursing, suggesting misalignment between the instrument’s ob-
              jectives and target beneficiaries.
           •	Several instruments are targeted at mature firms (regardless of their size) rather than for firms in
              the very early stages of development.
                •	Additionally, several instruments are available only to firms that are already profitable. This
                  likely excludes high-growth startups since they typically undergo a considerable pre-revenue
                  period, during which they are focused on growth and user-adoption. During this stage, high-
                  growth startups typically rely on grants or financing from accelerators, angel investors, or VCs.
                •	Relatedly, many instruments specifically target established technologies at high technology
                  readiness levels (TRLs, that is, mature, market-ready technologies); however, a supportive in-
                  novation ecosystem needs to provide support for technologies across the spectrum of tech-
                  nology-readiness.
           •	Individual entrepreneurs (as opposed to firms) have little direct funding.
           •	Very few policy instruments benefit ecosystem enablers, such as incubators, accelerators, and
              other critical actors. Efforts to recalibrate the policy mix must also include improving attention to
              national and localized entrepreneurship ecosystems. As discussed in a forthcoming recommen-
              dation, Romania’s subnational entrepreneurial ecosystems vary in quality of support, which in
              turn, translates to limited support to startups and innovative firms.
           •	Some instruments existed because of the direction of the European Commission, rather than hav-
              ing been identified as a particular systemic failure.
           •	Administrative costs for program management are high because it requires coordination between
              a Managing Authority and an Intermediary Body.
           •	Monitoring and evaluation capabilities of program staff are weak, limiting opportunities to under-
              stand the impact of existing instruments and scaling up of programs that are meeting and/or ex-
              ceeding program objectives. This indicates a need to improve capabilities of program implemen-
              tors for design, implementation, and governance, with a special focus on M&E.

          APPROACH 
          This recommendation is divided into three specific sub-categories:
               (1A) Rebalancing the policy mix,
               (1B) Improving functionality of the policy mix; and
               (2) Passing and implementing a comprehensive package of reforms, i.e., the National Startup
               Ecosystem Strategy.




  POLICY RECOMMENDATION 2 

  REFORM REGULATIONS TO STRENGTHEN
  ENTREPRENEURSHIP & INVESTMENTS

            MISSION                                     TIME                                         QUICK
            CRITICAL                                    SENSITIVE                                    WIN




          RATIONALE 
          As discussed in chapters 1 and 2, the current business environment is preventing firms from growing,
          scaling, and investments to occur:
             •	Although Romania performs well on entry of new firms, it does not have a high share of tech start-
               ups and especially high-potential startups. Much entrepreneurship in Romania is driven by ne-
               cessity, rather than opportunity, with many firms lacking the ambition to innovate or other char-
               acteristics to become high growth firms.
             •	Additionally, Romania does not have a culture that destigmatizes “rapid business failure” and
               promotes serial entrepreneurship.
             •	Romanian startups rely on self-financing and are unable to scale effectively. Startups, on aver-
               age, do not access traditional capital markets for scaling up. Instead, they rely on angel inves-
               tors, VCs (including corporate VC), or crowdfunding platforms.
             •	Regulations surrounding the ownership and commercialization of IP, especially that derived from
               universities and publicly-funded research, are widely seen as confused, conflicting and vaguely
               worded, requiring expert legal advice to interpret, and leaving much uncertainty concerning lia-
               bilities (which may include criminal offences for errors).52
             •	Public procurement is an important market for many startups and SMEs. Although recent reforms
               have improved awareness, the current public procurement processes and platforms are still per-
               ceived as difficult to access for startups and other small firms. Streamlining public procurement,
               with particular attention to the needs of innovative startups, can expand the domestic market for
               startups while simultaneously helping bring beneficial innovations into the public sector.

          APPROACH 
          This recommendation is divided into four reform areas.

               business;
             •	Investing in startups;
             •	Clarifying IP rights; and
             •	Improving access to public procurement opportunities.

          RATIONALE 
          The Romanian Startup ecosystem faces several challenges, including a lack of understanding of start-
          ups and how they differ from other SMEs, and reliable data about the ecosystem as a whole. SME
          legislation and the policy mix do not take into account the needs of young, growth-oriented firms with
          novel technology or new business models. There is also poor coordination between policymakers and
          startup ecosystem stakeholders. Despite promising regional clusters, Romanian startups have no co-
          herent national voice to champion their needs.

          In post-transition economies, very often the innovation or startup programming and agencies are es-
          tablished under the auspices of a ministry in charge of research, innovation, science, and technolog-
          ical development (Poland, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan) given that these ministries tend to
          have a stronger understanding of the nature of technology driven startups and the need to support
          R&D and innovation intensive companies in collaboration with the research sector. They also see it
          as a critical opportunity to prevent brain drain of young researchers or even promote brain gain from
          the among diaspora or international technical and research talent. Most importantly, however, is the
          importance of having a ministry with ownership and willingness to champion this cross-cutting agen-
          da of innovation and entrepreneurship. And alliances with ministries in charge of industry and econ-
          omy are not only natural but also highly desirable in the long term as these tend to very often be in-
          volved in critical business environment regulations (starting/closing a business, bankruptcy, investors
          regulations, R&D tax credits, etc.) that are necessary for the formation and growth of a healthy inno-
          vation and entrepreneurship/startup ecosystem, including the startups/scaleups, investors, and en-
          abler organizations.

          This would assist in clarifying the policy distinction between startups and SMEs, help negate issues
          of policy capture by incumbents (by providing a different cabinet-level champion), assist in promot-
          ing technology transfer and science-driven spinouts, and ensure that the agency remains focused on.


        53. When it comes to ease of starting a business, Romania has met objectives established by the European Commission’s
        Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW), “Start-up Procedures.” It takes 1-3 days
        to register a business and costs €26 (target is €100 or less). This is currently a paper-based procedure.

          APPROACH 
          We recommend that the first step should be to draft a ‘blueprint” of the new agency, taking into con-
          sideration the different roles that it might play. The overall objective of establishing an Ecosystem Hub
          is to create an institutional framework and implementation capacity to address structural challeng-
          es for startups, scale-ups, and facilitators of the innovation and entrepreneurship support. However,
          there are many different models of innovation agency or startup agency, and we recommend that the
          structure of this organization be determined after the strategy has been developed.

  STRENGTHEN ECOSYSTEM ENABLERS

          RATIONALE 
          In most ecosystems, ecosystem enablers (or “startup support organizations”) play an important role.
          There is evidence, for example, that accelerators can not only improve various success measures for
          startups that receive their services but may also play a wider ecosystem coordinating function.54 How-
          ever, at present there are relatively few such enablers in Romania, and those which exist are of limited
          capacity and variable quality. Most lack a rigorous monitoring and evaluation framework, which limits
          opportunities for learning and suggests the need for sharing good practices more widely. As indicat-
          ed by the policy mix analysis above, there are relatively few instruments which are devoted to support-
          ing ecosystem enablers, meaning that many ecosystem enablers are under-resourced and rely on fi-
          nancing and support from donors.

          In addition, existing ecosystem enablers are concentrated primarily in the Bucharest-Ilfov region, with
          few entrepreneurship support structures outside of the main hubs. Enabler organizations located be-
          yond the main hubs tend to have weaker access to networks, including financial capital and capacity
          building. Given that the Bucharest-Ilfov region has the highest rate of new firm creation and highest
          share of young and high-growth firms, it is understandable that private-sector enablers would choose
          to locate themselves here, where demand is greatest. However, this concentration risks exacerbating
          regional economic disparities.

          Data suggests that the major ecosystems outside the Bucharest-Ilfov region are around Cluj-Napoca,
          Iasi, Timisoara and Constanta. However, the data also suggests that startups in these other ecosys-
          tems remain highly dependent upon the Bucharest ecosystem for university talent and facilities, ac-
          celerators, and funders.

          APPROACH 
          We suggest the need for a program to strengthen ecosystem enablers across Romania. The aim of
          such program would be to build overall capacity (especially outside the Bucharest-Ilfov region), to im-
          prove quality and performance measurement, and to increase the connections between enablers (in
          order to encourage sharing of good practice, as well as their access to resources).

          The program should also include capacity-development grants for ecosystem enablers (potentially re-
          quiring matched funding from other sources such as local authorities, VCs, or corporates). Such grants
          could be spent in various ways, including such activities as subsidized makerspaces, rapid-prototyp-
          ing facilities and the provision of stipends from accelerators to entrepreneurs in order to allow found-
          ers to concentrate on startup-building activities (as is common in many other accelerator programs).

          RATIONALE 
          Risk finance is a critical requirement for starting and scaling new firms. However, the Romanian VC
          sector is under-developed, meaning that VC remains difficult to access. Numbers of VC deals, and to-
          tal value invested, are low in comparison with other European countries – although numbers of deals
          and transaction value increased quite rapidly between 2019 and 2021. As discussed in the policy mix
          analysis above, available public instruments prioritize post-revenue firms and do not provide financial
          support for firms at the earliest and riskiest stages.


          APPROACH 
          This recommendation proposes establishing a new public fund to increase amount of direct capital
          into startups and riskier stage firms.55 The design of the Startup Fund and its instruments should be
          informed by an in-depth study of the existing entrepreneurial finance landscape, including the existing
          supply of corporate VC and investment from overseas VC firms, as well as estimates of likely demand
          from Romanian startups and specific financing gaps.56 However, we suggest that careful considera-
          tion be given to its establishment as a co-investment fund, in order to encourage the development of
          private sector VCs, rather than displace this activity.

          The fund could be Government owned, although it is strongly recommended that it involves private-sec-
          tor partners and expertise, including a performance-driven process for investment selection and due
          consideration of the need to develop a pipeline of sufficient deal-flow to sustain the development of


        55. In recognition of the public sector’s role in supporting startups, many countries are launching specific finance instruments. This
        list includes France, Serbia, Chile, and many others.
        56. Though the EIF recently conducted an landscape analysis to inform a Fund of Funds intervention within the National Resilience
        and Recovery Plan, riskier stage firms, including startups, still appear to be un/underserved by this proposed instrument.

         private sector investors. There may be opportunities to leverage the diaspora network (see recommen-
         dation below) to identify co-investors.

         In terms of fund size and stage, there is a particular need for pre-seed- and seed-stage funding in Ro-
         mania, so we suggest that a sizeable portion of the fund should be dedicated to these stages. The ex-
         act size of the fund should be determined following the proposed study.

          RATIONALE 
         Universities can play many important roles in stimulating entrepreneurship – such as inspiring stu-
         dents and cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset, providing entrepreneurial skills, directly assisting
         the formation of spinouts, and transferring technologies to existing young firms to enable them to be-
         come more innovative. However, most of these functions are weaker in Romania than in other Euro-
         pean countries. Although Romania has a high share of STEM graduates, this has not translated into
         high numbers of innovative startups.

         Of particular concern is the quality of entrepreneurship education: whilst there have been numerous
         programs to improve entrepreneurial training, many entrepreneurs still complain that their university
         education did not provide them with appropriate knowledge or skills, with academic teaching of entre-
         preneurship being perceived as low quality, outdated, and disconnected from real-world experience.
         This is exacerbated by the fact that many teachers and lecturing staff have limited exposure to the
         private sector. Entrepreneurial skills also pose considerable challenges to university management, in-
         cluding staff responsible for overall planning and budgeting and academic development.


          APPROACH 
         Several previous projects funded by the European Commission have tried to improve entrepreneuri-
         al skills training and ‘third mission’ activities within Romanian universities. In addition, a number of
         highly relevant pilot programs were implemented in the World Bank project “Supporting Innovation in
         Romanian Catching-up Regions”. We therefore recommend that a review of these projects is under-
         taken before new initiatives are launched or these programs are scaled.

         In addition, we suggest that this section should be read with reference to the others; specifically, there
         may be opportunities to combine entrepreneurial skills training with digital skills training (as discussed
         under ‘Promote the Digital Economy’), and a need to co-ordinate the supply-side interventions dis-
         cussed in this section with the demand-size interventions of the following section (‘Incentivize innova-
         tion to foster knowledge spillovers into the private sector’).

          With that said, we recommend that several actions would improve entrepreneurship education for stu-
          dents, for career counselors and university lecturers, as well as building wider entrepreneurial capa-
          bilities within these institutions, and engagement with the wider ecosystem:

          RATIONALE 
          As discussed in Chapter 1, Romania suffers a “brain drain” of talent. As well as making better use
          of the emigrant diaspora, we suggest this drain should be countered through pro-active ‘brain gain’
          measures, aimed at attracting talent and other resources into Romania. Specifically, we recommend
          a Startup Visa scheme to provide a simple fast-track for immigrant entrepreneurs or investors wish-
          ing to relocate to Romania.

          In addition, we recommend an expansion of the existing “digital nomad” scheme, since there are like-
          ly to be spillover benefits for startups arising from an increased concentration of high-quality digitally
          experienced talent, even if such individuals are not entrepreneurs themselves. Various studies have
          shown that promoting such mobility stimulates an exchange of ideas which foster and encourage eco-
          nomic growth.59 Other possible spillover effects include increased usage of online platforms, which
          can help push adoption within Romania.


          APPROACH 
          Startup Visas (also referred to as ‘Entrepreneurs Visas’ or ‘Innovators Visa’) are used by over 30 coun-
          tries across the world to attract immigrant entrepreneurs who are deemed likely to contribute to the lo-
          cal economy. Typically, such visas enable residency for a period, subject to certain conditions – which
          may include an assessment of the feasibility of the applicant’s business idea and its potential scal-
          ability, sponsorship by an ecosystem enabler in the host country, proof of sufficient capital or other

          means to support themselves and any dependents, and foreign language skills. Some schemes also
          apply criteria relating to the startup’s age, investment, or turnover; a few schemes, such as Lithuania’s
          Startup Visa, also limit startups to specific technology sectors. In some cases, a Startup Visa converts
          to a permanent residency visa if certain conditions are met.

          Some Startup Visa schemes extend to investors, too. For example, Portugal’s Startup Visa offers a
          fast track to foreign investors (and their dependents) from non-EU countries to obtain a Residence
          Permit in Portugal. To be eligible, investors must invest €175,000 into a business incubator includ-
          ing €25,000 of capitalization into the venture. Investors are also required to work with a business in-
          cubator for three years.60

          RATIONALE 
          Human capital is vital for the development of startups. However, it is well-known that Romania has
          for several years suffered from a “brain drain”, with much top talent leaving the country. In addition,
          the pandemic has dramatically accelerated remote working across the globe, giving rise to new risks
          of a “virtual brain drain”, whereby talent is (remotely) poached by overseas firms and is thus unavail-
          able to local startups. However, the presence of a large Romanian diaspora (the fifth largest diaspo-
          ra group in the world) also creates a significant opportunity: a network which can support Romanian
          entrepreneurs in expanding overseas, as well as potentially acting as investors and advisors. Moreo-
          ver, the globalization of talent also creates opportunities to gather ideas, insights, and best practices
          from across the globe which can be applied to support the starting and scaling of firms in Romania.
          Successful Romanian startups and Romanian diaspora have greater expertise, exposure, and net-
          works than the general population of Romanian tech startups.61

          In addition, there are opportunities to improve the visibility of Romanian startups and technology in
          other countries. Doing so will help raise the profile of the ecosystem among potential customers, inves-
          tors, and other ecosystem participants, improving both market access and foreign investment into Ro-
          manian startups. (See also the recommendations below concerning ‘Scale-up through exports’; these
          recommendations should be coordinated.)

          APPROACH 
         We recommend the creation and curation of a new network of Romanian founders and diaspora, which
         connects with Romanian ecosystem enablers. The initial core of this network may be identified using
         existing databases of high growth startups, including diaspora entrepreneurs and female entrepre-
         neurs. It may potentially also include prominent business leaders, researchers, investors and so on.
         The launch of this network should be supported by a wide-reaching marketing and communications
         campaign, leveraging use of tech blogs, popular social media platforms, and other media.

         This network will require a clear value proposition for members to join, as well as ongoing curation and
         regular “value-adding” events in order to ensure it remains sufficiently attractive for members to re-
         main involved. We suggest that this may require testing or piloting in advance of the network’s crea-
         tion, but it may include: networking events (potentially hosted by local embassies or consulates); op-
         portunities to influence Romania’s ambitious national startup support strategy; media exposure and
         opportunities to showcase successful startups at leading industry events (e.g. Slush, VivaTech, the

         This recommendation focuses on improving access of Romanian startups to overseas markets through
         diplomatic missions and leveraging the Romanian founders and diaspora network (see recommenda-
         tion above) in critical markets.

         The domestic market for many digital startups is inhibited by low level of digital skills and limited use
         of e-commerce platforms among the general public. Unfortunately, export rates among Romanian
         firms are also very low in comparison with other countries. Many entrepreneurs report being dissuad-
         ed from exporting because they do not understand the conditions and culture in overseas markets,
         and do not know where to start. This is exacerbated by the under-development of overseas networks;
         by the lack of understanding of startups amongst trade attachés and related civil servants; and by
         a lack of appropriate skills and confidence amongst entrepreneurs. There is also a perceived lack of
         support from government and Romanian trade offices abroad for startups seeking to internationalize.
         Furthermore, many entrepreneurs report poor perceptions of Romanian startups abroad, which may
         present a further barrier to exporters.

         In addition, there is a need for better strategic advice to startups, as there is a tendency for Romani-
         an firms to target “aspirational” markets, such as Estonia, rather than basing their choice of markets
         on knowledge of existing trade links, diaspora connections, and so on.

             and understand the presence of, and possible support from, Romanian diaspora (as per the rec-
             ommendation above). Such a study will inform the following actions.
           •	Encouraging Economic Counsellors / Commercial Attachés within Romanian diplomatic missions
             (embassies and consulates) located in key markets to promote Romanian startups (e.g., special-
             ized awareness-raising events involving high-quality Romanian entrepreneurs and key stakehold-
             ers from local startup ecosystems);

         The recommendation, “Improve Entrepreneurship Education and strengthen the role of Universities
         in the ecosystem”, sought to stimulate the supply of innovation from public research. However, if this
         supply is not met with a corresponding demand from within the private sector, then it is unlikely to re-
         sult in more innovations being brought to market. This recommendation therefore aims to encourage
         the demand side of innovation within the private sector, which is currently relatively weak in compar-
         ison with other European countries. This recommendation is not intended to address the wider gaps
         relating of technology adoption and non-R&D innovation which exist within Romania, which we recog-
         nize as important, but which are beyond the scope of this report.


          APPROACH 
         Various approaches to building linkages between research organizations and firms are being trialed in
         the World Bank’s “Supporting Innovation in Romanian Catching-up Regions” program, although most
         of the interventions piloted in that program are “supply-side” focused. We suggest that several activi-
         ties can be taken now to stimulate the demand side of this technology transfer, including:
             •	Incentivizing R&D in early-stage firms;
             •	Encouraging Consortia for Collaborative Research;
             •	Establishing Knowledge Transfer Secondments; and
             •	Innovation Vouchers.

    POLICY RECOMMENDATION 11 

    PROMOTE THE DIGITAL ECONOMY

                FOUNDATIONAL                                   TIME                                          GOVERNMENT
                LONGTERM                                       SENSITIVE                                     SUPPORT NEEDED




             RATIONALE 
               Romania ranks 27th of 27 EU Member States in the 2021 edition of the Digital Economy and Socie-
               ty Index (DESI). While Romania ranks highly on connectivity (10th), it ranks lowly on most indicators
               measured by this index including:
                   •	25th on Integration of digital technology in businesses’ activities which shows that 17 percent
                     of SMEs sell online; and 33 percent of SMEs have at least a basic level of digital intensity; and
                   •	26th on human capital which shows that digital skills is low: 31 percent of individuals have ba-
                     sic digital skills (compared to EU average of 56 percent), 10 percent of individuals have above
                     basic digital skills (compared to EU average of 31 percent); and 35 percent of individuals have
                     at least basic software skills (compared to EU average of 58 percent); and 6 percent of firms of-
                     fering ICT training.


             APPROACH 
               This recommendation is divided into three specific sub-categories.
                  •	Category 1: Promoting e-commerce platforms
                  •	Category 2: Increasing Digital Skills
                  •	Category 3: Improving Managerial Skills62

            62. Recent studies (https://voxeu.org/article/thriving-post-pandemic-economy) highlight the importance of managerial practices for
            digitalization: firms that have better management practices are more prone to adopting digital technologies and do it faster.

APPENDIX B 
METHODOLOGY OF THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
ENABLER SURVEY
The entrepreneurship ecosystem mapping of enabler organizations was assessed through a survey. The ques-
tionnaire targeted organizations that support entrepreneurship, beyond public agencies (although still includ-
ing nongovernmental organizations which may have received public support). Such organizations—which include
incubators, accelerators, and industry associations—are referred to as enablers or intermediary organizations.
As a first step, a list of relevant Romanian enablers was identified. Several World Bank Group projects and initi-
atives were consulted to compile the list for the questionnaires, and feedback from local staff and consultants
was also incorporated.

Programs that clearly identify supporting entrepreneurship were included in the sample. Overall, 488 ena-
bler organizations supporting entrepreneurship were identified as the universe of interest for this analysis and
the sample (53 organizations were contacted based on
their relevance). The response rate for the survey was
60 percent (table B.1).                                TABLE B.1  Sample and Response Rates

two weeks to complete the questionnaire, during which
project team members also reached out to them by phone to ensure timely completion of the surveys. In situations
where questionnaires were not completed sufficiently on the first attempt, an additional attempt was undertaken
to gather information from an alternative respondent. The study methodology was adapted to the Romanian con-
text. Implementation had to be compliant with COVID-19 government protocols, which led to the decision to use
computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) to replace face
to face interviews, as initially planned by the team.

     To get a representative sample of these datasets, the firms were grouped by region (Bucharest, Cluj, Brasov and
     others) and by industry (computer programming, high-tech manufacturing and other digital). Within each group
     (cell) the order of firms was randomized and was extracted representative samples for every cell. The final list was
     split in different ordered batches. Each batch contained 500 firms and it was handed to Metro Media Transilvania
     (MMT)64 to conduct the surveys in three months.

     MMT used 6 batches of firms, there was a response rate close to 18 percent, and 542 responses were obtained.
     The sample obtained was verified and was in line with the sample design. All the results were weighted, and the
     findings are summarized in table C.3.

    POTENTIAL)
    The PitchBook/CB Insights data contains all the firms that are registered in the PitchBook and CB Insights data-
    set and are labeled as Romanian. These firms are not classified by region and are not digital only. Also, these
    firms might be older than 5 years old. The total universe of firms in this dataset is 448 and using a matching algo-
    rithm, with human support, it was found that 130 firms match the Romanian Business Registry with a 100 per-
    cent of certainty and 26 firms matched with a certainty of 90 percent. Only 30 of all the matching firms are con-
    tained in the Lista Firme dataset. Due to the small population of firms, a sample of 200 firms randomized sample
    was selected. 105 responses were obtained. Table C.4 shows the composition of firms identified in the PitchBook
    and CB Insights lists.

     Physical Capital and Infrastructure

     Information technology is a key factor for the development of entrepreneurship. According to Eurostats 2020,
     Bucuresti/Ilfov (96 percent), Nord-Vest (90 percent) and Vest (91 percent) have the highest population that have
     access to the Internet at home and broadband access. The rest of the regions access between 80 and 90 percent.

     Access to mobility is also a key characteristic of successful entrepreneurship ecosystems. According to the
     World Bank Group Entrepreneurship Survey (2020), firms in the Nord-Vest (12.9 percent), Sud-Est (13.7 percent)
     and Bucharesti-Ilfov (23.1 percent) regions considered that transportation is not a major constraint for their busi-
     ness (figure D.1). On the other hand, the Vest (52 percent) and Centru (36.5 percent) and Sud-Muntenia (32.8
     percent) regions reported that transportation is one of their major constraints for businesses.

     Human and Knowledge Capital

     Human capital is mainly concentrated in Bucuresti-Ilfov. According to Eurostats 2020, the Bucaresti/Ilfov region
     has the population with the highest level of education in the country (40.5 percent), followed by the Nord-Vest
     (20.1 percent) and Centru (17.1 percent) regions (figure D.2). Similarly, the Bucuresti/Ilfov region has the highest
     concentration of human capital working on research and technology, and the highest number of R&D personnel

     and researchers in comparison to the rest of the country. Bucuresti/Ilfov also has the highest R&D expenditure in
     the country (€280.1 per inhabitant); the second highest expenditure is in the Vest region (€35.5 per inhabitant).
     This concentration of human capital in Bucaresti/Ilfov is a key factor for the development of knowledge-intensive
     activities in this region and explains why all the analyzed ecosystems clustered here.

     However, firms report that an inadequately educated workforce is a major constraint. According to the World
     Bank Enterprise Survey (2020), firms in Bucuresti-Ilfov (63.2 percent), Centru (53.2 percent) and Vest (51.4 per-
     cent) identified an inadequately educated workforce as a major constraint on their businesses, followed by firms
     in Sud-Est (39.4 percent), Nord-Est (38.8 percent), Nord-Vest (29.6 percent) and Sud-Muntenia (24.6 percent).
     This means that, despite having a highly educated workforce in these regions, the educated workforce is still not
     sufficient for the growth of innovative firms.

     Top management experience is also unevenly distributed. The Sud-Est, Nord-Est and Centru regions reported
     that the top managers have the greatest number of years working in the firm’s sector (22 years on average). Top
     managers in Sud-Muntenia, Vest, and Bucuresti-Ilfov have the fewest years in the sector (17 years on average).

     Foreign ownership signals the international focus of firms, and this is a source of non-endogamic knowl-
     edge. Bucharesti-Ilfov has the highest concentration of firms with at least 10 percent of foreign ownership (12.9
     percent), followed by Vest (5.7 percent) and Centru (4.7) (figure D.3). The lowest share of companies with for-
     eign ownership is in the Nord-Est and Sud-Est regions. Additionally, the Vest region has the highest percent of
     firms with an internationally recognized quality certification (68.8 percent), followed by the Bucuresti-Ilfov (39.4
     percent) and Centru (39 percent) regions. Sud-Muntenia has the lowest percent of these kind of firms (10.4 per-
     cent). It is important to notice that the regions that have high-potential ecosystems are among the regions that
     have more international connections.

     Access to Finance
     Regions with important ecosystems recognize that finance is a major constraint, and they need different
     sources of funding than the traditional ones in the country. Firms in the Centru region identified that access to
     finance as a major constraint for the development of their businesses (32.1 percent), followed by Vest (26.2 per-
     cent) and Bucuresti-Ilfov region (25.7 percent) (figure D.4). On the other hand, Sud-Est and Nord-Est regional are
     the regions that expressed that finance is not a major constraint. Additionally, in the Sud-Est and Vest regions, a

high share of firms reported that they do not need a loan (72.5 percent and 66.0 percent, respectively). Fewer
firms in Bucharest-Ilfov, Centru, and Sud-Muntenia reported needing loans (46.7 percent, 42.4 percent and 38.6
percent, respectively). Finally, in terms of access to finance, 79.9 percent of firms in Centru reported that they
have a bank loan / line of credit, followed by Nord-Vest (50.9 percent), and Vest (44.6 percent). It is important to
notice that most of startup funding comes from personal or family savings in Romania.

Regulations

Firms in different regions perceive licensing and permits, labor regulations, and tax rates to be obstacles.
Overall, few firms in Bucuresti-Ilfov (1 percent), Centru (1.7 percent) and Nord-Vest (3 percent) regions report that
business licensing and permits are their biggest obstacle (figure D.5). On the contrary, forms in Nord-Est and Sud-
Muntenia (7.9 percent) think that licensing and permits are obstacles for their businesses. Moreover, firms in the
Centru region pointed out that labor regulation is one of their biggest obstacles (11.7 percent), followed by Nord-
Est (5.4 percent) and Bucuresti-Ilfov (4.1 percent). On the contrary, firms in Nord-Vest, Sud-Est, and Vest do not
consider labor regulation as a key constraint for their businesses. The Sud-Muntenia (8.6 percent), Nord-Est (6.9
percent) and Bucharest-Ilfov (6.9 percent) regions explained that tax administration is their biggest obstacle for
entrepreneurship. Moreover, Sud-Est (32.4 percent), Nord-Est (27.5 percent), and Sud-Muntenia (20.4) reported
tax rates as an obstacle for entrepreneurship. And to a lesser extent, Vest (19.7 percent), Centru (19.3 percent),
Nord-Vest (16.2 percent), and Bucuresti-Ilfov (15.7 percent) think this is true.

    APPENDIX E 
    THE CONNECTEDNESS ANALYSIS
    The nodes of the network represent the individual entities in the ecosystem (startups, investors, accelerators/
    incubators, mentors) and the edges (links) are the relationships that exists between them.



	E.1	 NETWORK                 MEASURES
    Calculating the centrality measures in this network builds understanding of which are the most important players
    in the ecosystem. In this analysis, three centrality measures were used:

    Degree centrality measures the number of other nodes within the ecosystem to which each node is directly con-
    nected. It does not consider any second-order connections.

    Eigenvector centrality measures the number of other nodes that are connected directly to the node but considers
    how well connected the other nodes are. In other words, the importance of a given node is based on the impor-
    tance of the other nodes that are associated with it.

    Modularity is a measure of the structure of the network. This uses an optimization method that measures the
    strength of the division of the network into modules (groups, clusters, or communities). Based on these strengths,
    it detects community structures.

APPENDIX F 
GLOSSARY OF KEY CONCEPTS
Access to Finance: In the context of this white paper, access to finance refers to the availability and accessibil-
ity of appropriate funding mechanisms for entrepreneurs and firms. Types of financial instruments include loans
from commercial banks, grants, financing from angel investors/networks, and private equity/VC funding. Access
to finance is indicated by many sources as an important enabler of entrepreneurship, with firm growth often con-
strained by the availability of funding. Finance needs to be available throughout the country in sufficient quanti-
ties, in different forms, and with sufficient risk-appetite from the financer.

Access to Markets: Also referred to as “market access,” this refers to the ability of a company or country to sell
goods and services within and across borders. Market access can be used to refer to domestic trade as well as
international trade, although the latter is the most common context.

Agglomeration economies: This refers to the benefits that come when firms and people locate near one another
together in cities and industrial clusters. It is mostly associated with transport cost savings, which facilitates the
exchange of goods, services, and ideas. In this report, the term “agglomeration” is used to identify concentration
of firms in a geographic location.

Culture: This refers to social norms, perceptions, and attitudes that influence an individual or society. Culture mat-
ters for entrepreneurship since evidence suggests that entrepreneurial attitudes are shaped by culture to some
degree. Entrepreneurial activity at a country level is strongly correlated with positive perceptions of entrepreneur-
ship and entrepreneurial opportunities. Moreover, there is evidence that exposure to innovation substantially
increases the chances that children become inventors, and that the presence of visible role models of entrepre-
neurs may influence a person’s decision to becoming one, indicating that social factors matter.

Digital Platforms: This refers to an online channel that creates value through facilitating exchanges between two
or more interdependent groups.

E-Commerce: This refers to the buying and selling of goods over the Internet. It can be a substitute for ‘brick and
mortar’ stores, but some businesses maintain both.

Entrepreneurship: This refers to the activity of setting up a business or businesses. Specific to this white paper,
we will focus on a subset of entrepreneurs starting growth-oriented innovative firms. High growth-firms aim to cre-
ate large, vibrant businesses that grow rapidly, much beyond an individual’s subsistence needs, and intends to
create significant income and jobs for others65. Throughout this paper, the terms “high growth firm” and “high
growth entrepreneur” are used interchangeably.

Entrepreneurship Ecosystem: This refers to a system of interconnected and interdependent actors and resources
that directly and indirectly support the creation and growth of new ventures. Ecosystems also refer to a physical
environment whose development and growth are catalyzed by social and economic factors, for example, Silicon
Valley, which is renowned for its startups that turn into international technology giants such as Apple, Google,
PayPal, and much more.

Human Capital: This refers to the availability of skills necessary to support growth entrepreneurship. This includes,
but is not limited to, managerial skills and technical skills (such as advanced digital skills). Skilled talent is a crit-
ical input for high growth firms. Skills shortages pose a great challenge to the innovative potential of the entre-
preneurship ecosystem.

Infrastructure: This refers to the fundamental facilities and systems that facilitates connectivity; trade; the ex-
changes of goods, services, and ideas; and knowledge spillovers. By improving connectivity in physical realms

(better roads, trains, general transport), we facilitate connectedness between stakeholders. By providing Internet
access and ability to use it, we open new opportunities for entrepreneurs and future markets. By creating more
enablers, such as providing more space for research and development (R&D) and entrepreneurs, we create a
denser network and a more robust innovation ecosystem.

Mature (SME/startup): This refers to firms that have reached post-expansion/post-growth stages and are in their
consolidation phase.

Research & Development & Innovation: This refers to the set of activities undertaken by corporations, govern-
ments, universities, or other actors to develop new products or services and improve existing ones. Innovation
requires conscious effort to develop new ideas for products and processes.

Regulatory Framework: In the context of this report, “regulatory framework” refers to laws, regulations, policies,
decrees, and executive orders developed and officially approved by the government to regulate the business envi-
ronment, particularly related to startups. The regulatory environment can significantly help or hinder startups.
Startups have numerous interactions with the state, from the initial process of company formation, to hiring or
dismissing employees, obtaining permits, and resolving insolvency. Evidence suggests that the lighter the admin-
istrative burden of the processes, the more readily startups can form and scale.

Scale-ups: This refers to the stage where an idea is already commercialized and is being scaled up for growth and
expansion, often requiring financing by debt or equity.

SMEs: This report adopts the European Commission definition,66 which is based on two factors: (1) staff head-
count and (2) either turnover or balance sheet totals.67 It further qualifies the definition of SMEs based on age of
firm. See Chapter 3 for additional details.

Company category                           Staff headcount                       Turnover                 -OR-           Balance sheet total

Medium-sized                                     < 250                           ≤ €50M                                         ≤ €43M

Micro                                             < 10                            ≤ €2M                                          ≤ €2M



Startups: This refers to enterprises typically under 5 years old where an idea already has gone through prototyp-
ing or is in the pre-commercial/commercial stages.

Support Programs: This refers to programs or instruments, implemented by public or private sector actors, that
stimulate and/or support innovation and entrepreneurship. Support programs may take many different forms,
including provision of financial, infrastructure or technical support, such as advice and mentorship. Other pro-
grams (such as accelerators or “startup hubs”) may be specifically intended to signpost or coordinate multiple
activities or provide multiple services.

67. These ceilings apply to the figures for individual firms only. A firm that is part of a larger group may need to include staff headcount/turno-
ver/balance sheet data from that group too.
