x	
completed its early-stage PSW evaluation in 2021, when the performance
had been assessed to be “mixed.” The coverage of countries has increased
from 8 in 2018 to 39 in 2023. The report shows that PSW has helped miti-
gate the effects of the recent global crises, which is noteworthy as there has
been a deterioration in overall investment conditions in IDA and FCV coun-
tries during PSW implementation. The report also confirms that a growing
number of PSW-supported projects were in sectors that IFC and MIGA “had
never invested in” prior to PSW (45). These attest to the contribution of
IDA resources and the collaboration across World Bank Group institutions
to address market failures, catalyze private sector development, and create
markets in support of growth and job creation.

Management is also pleased with the strong uptake in usage of PSW
resources and welcomes the evidence attributing this to improvements in
PSW administration and increased trust across IDA, IFC, and MIGA. This is
particularly encouraging given the slow start under the 18th Replenishment
of IDA, when only 53 percent of allocated resources were used. PSW window
resources were used almost entirely in the 19th Replenishment of IDA
and are on course for full use in IDA20 if current levels continue through
FY24–25. The report suggests that the scale-up in usage is attributable to
improvements in PSW administration including more efficient paperwork
and approval processes, filling up of knowledge gaps related to functioning
of the window, and increased trust among the three agencies. This
experience provides lessons for implementing the new Bank Group playbook
for greater institutional collaboration.                                         Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    xi

Management appreciates the report’s recognition that PSW projects have
addressed private investment constraints better than non-PSW projects and
notes the opportunities for increasing PSW’s nonfinancial additionality.
In line with the rationale for setting up the PSW, the window is addressing
constraints to private sector development, including the absence of local
currency financing, market disruptions owing to exogenous factors, and
unfavorable business environments. At the same time, management notes
the report’s conclusion that the PSW portfolio has not yet demonstrated a
visible improvement in some of the nonfinancial additionality when com-
pared with non-PSW projects, particularly those related to standard-setting

xii	
capital adequacy framework, the IDA Chief Risk Officer has conducted a
comprehensive risk modeling exercise for the PSW. Forthcoming discussions
during the IDA20 MTR will involve considering a reduction in the capital
set aside for the PSW, currently set at 100 percent, to enhance PSW capital
allocation. Increasing the leverage of IDA capital by lowering the capital set-
aside will enable PSW to incorporate additional instruments that enhance
private capital mobilization. Pending endorsement by IDA participants, PSW
is planning to introduce two new MIGA facilities: a Trade Finance Guarantee
and a Liquidity Support Guarantee.

Management agrees with the second recommendation that IDA, IFC, and
MIGA report their respective financial results of the IDA PSW. A regular
financial management report of PSW that includes the financial results of
IDA, IFC, and MIGA respectively, would enhance the ability of management
and the Board of Executive Directors to make informed capital allocation
decisions across diverse facilities and instruments, drawing on the unique
strengths of each institution for impactful private sector investments.
Management will work on the reporting details and responsibilities for
implementing this recommendation as part of the Management Action
Record process.

nonfinancial additionality by providing industry expertise, capacity-building
advisory and better monitoring to PSW-eligible countries. For instance, IFC
has increased its capacity to deliver environmental and social knowledge and
standard-setting advisory (one of the most common forms of nonfinancial
additionality) by locating more staff in the field in challenging markets. This
allows IFC to undertake in-depth country-level interventions, tackling sys-
temic Environmental, Social, and Governance risks at firm, market, or regu-
latory levels in countries like Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea, and Kosovo.

IFC management regrets that PSW governance was out of scope for this
report. It is important to note that when the PSW was established, it was
considered a pilot and guardrails were put in place to support its governance
and management. With six years of experience of the PSW and more than
200 projects, it is critical to review the governance structures to assess what
is working and what can be improved and streamlined or both to ensure an
efficient deployment of funds.


Recommendations
Recommendation 1: IDA, IFC, and MIGA would benefit from enhanced mod-
eling of the risks taken by the PSW.

Management fully agrees with IEG’s conclusion that usage of the PSW could
be optimized by better leveraging IDA’s capital. As stated in the report, IDA’s
practice of setting aside capital for maximum potential losses under the PSW
is highly conservative. Given the robust and growing demand for the PSW           Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    xv
(IFC’s PSW pipeline is currently over $2 billion, indicating that IFC is likely
to exceed its IDA20 envelop), revisiting the capital framework is key to un-
locking additional funds that could support higher PSW allocations. Earlier
this year, the IDA Chief Risk Officer—the entity responsible for risk man-
agement of IDA capital, including the PSW—initiated its first risk modeling
analysis in relation to PSW leverage. The review points to the potential to
free up significant funds by reducing IDA’s capital provisioning. We look for-
ward to a discussion of this analysis at the IDA20 MTR. Finally, we note IEG’s
point on including an analysis of usage of the pooled first-loss coverage in
the modeling exercise, and suggest that it would be beneficial to assess all
PSW products rather than limiting the review to one instrument.

by the report. Additionally, the report confirms the role of MGF in enabling
MIGA to expand its operations into new countries and sectors and addresses
emerging crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite its relatively small size, the MGF has proven to be one of the most
efficient facilities of IDA PSW. MIGA is pleased to report that the MGF
has had the least concessionality among all IDA PSW facilities, standing
at 1.5 percent of total project costs. Furthermore, it boasts the highest
“mobilization ratio,” which is calculated as the total project cost over the
amount of the PSW used in the project at the time of Board approval. For
every $1 of the MGF, there is a total mobilization of $12.2.

The report advocated enhanced modeling of the risks taken by the PSW. In
particular, the report suggests an approach to modeling that uses default
data from the past six years and other proxy sources of data to evaluate
risk profiles under different stress scenarios. However, MIGA deems this
approach to be insufficient and raises concerns about the potential for an
inadequate allocation of IDA risk capital. MIGA emphasizes the necessity of
adopting a more prudent risk modeling strategy that incorporates a longer
period of risk events, rather than relying solely on the records of realized
losses from the past six years of IDA PSW.

this effort, MIGA already provides a service to IDA’s financial counterparts
by modeling loss reserves for each contract with MGF first-loss support,
as outlined in the signed agreement. MIGA both provides the necessary
information for the modeling exercise and performs it on behalf of IDA.
This arrangement was established because IDA’s financial counterpart,
responsible for other loan loss provisioning computations, relies on MIGA’s
unique expertise and tools for calculating loss provisioning for Political Risk
Insurance risks. MIGA is pleased to assist IDA with any additional analysis
required to further enhance risk assessment.

Report to the Board from the
Committee on Development
Effectiveness

The Committee on Development Effectiveness met to consider the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) report A Focused Assessment of the
International Development Association’s Private Sector Window: An Update
to the Independent Evaluation Group’s 2021 Early-Stage Assessment and the
World Bank Group draft management response.

The committee welcomed the update to the 2021 early-stage assessment
and highly appreciated IEG’s efforts to offer, in a timely manner, valuable
findings and recommendations as well as insights and lessons relevant to the
priorities of the World Bank Group Evolution and the new Playbook. These
served as useful information for the Mid-Term Review discussions of the
20th Replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA20),
ahead of the IDA21 Replenishment.

Some members noted the need to incorporate analysis of development
impact in future evaluations of the Private Sector Window (PSW). Members
concurred with the two IEG recommendations on better leveraging the

                                                                                 Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    xix
International Development Association (IDA) PSW capital and enhancing
financial reporting on the PSW across the Bank Group. They appreciated
management’s agreement with the conclusions of the report and its
commitment to implement the recommendations as One World Bank
Group. The committee was pleased to note a significant increase in PSW use
following the slow start in the IDA18 cycle, an early indication of the market
creation impact from PSW investments, and an expansion of the PSW to
new countries and sectors. They expressed concern that in PSW-eligible
countries overall, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) average
annual commitments were lower in the six years after the PSW launch than
in the six years before the launch. There was also concern that, in several
cases, clients pointed out that IFC prices were higher—despite the use of
PSW—than those of its competitors. Members welcomed IEG’s finding

Overview

Background
The private sector is essential for creating jobs and prosperity in poor
countries, but developing it is challenging, especially in fragile and
conflict-affected situations (FCS). The private sector provides 90 percent of
jobs and is the largest source of income for people living in International
Development Association (IDA) countries (World Bank 2017), in turn
contributing to economic development, poverty reduction, and achievement
of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, weak macroeconomic and
regulatory environments, infrastructure bottlenecks, and limited skilled
labor forces make it difficult for domestic and international investors to
engage, particularly in FCS, which also present security risks. As a result,
poor countries have limited abilities to attract private investment and grow
the local private sector, which hinders their development.

Blended finance, which mixes public development resources with private
funds, can help attract private investment and grow the local private sec-
tor in poor countries. Blended finance complements macroeconomic and
regulatory reforms by deploying public development resources to improve
the risk-return profile of individual investments in developing countries,

                                                                                 Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    xxi
demonstrating the viability of projects, and contributing to building mar-
kets. It is a powerful tool to finance development because achieving the
Sustainable Development Goals and the commitments under the Paris
Agreement requires substantially more financing than official development
assistance and development finance institutions can provide.

The IDA Private Sector Window (PSW) is a Blended Finance Facility (BFF)
that enables the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and third-party private sector
investors to conduct high-risk transactions in IDA and FCS countries. The
private sector is reluctant to invest in IDA and FCS (PSW-eligible) countries
because of challenges including (i) limited financing, particularly long-term
and local currency financing; (ii) disruptions triggered by exogenous factors,

Evaluation Objectives, Scope, and Methods
This evaluation reviews IDA PSW projects approved in FY18–23; it updates
the 2021 Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) early-stage assessment of
the PSW and complements the 20th Replenishment of IDA (IDA20) PSW
Mid-Term Review. At the request of the Board’s Committee on Development
Effectiveness, this evaluation updates the 2021 IEG early-stage assessment
of the PSW, which covered the first three years of implementation of this
instrument (FY18–20). This evaluation assesses the PSW across three IDA
cycles: IDA18, which covers FY18–20; IDA19, which covers FY21–22; and
IDA20, which covers FY23–25. The evaluation covers IFC and MIGA (be-
cause the two institutions originate the projects) and IDA (which offers
concessional support). This is a “focused evaluation” (like the IEG 2021
early-stage assessment) because it assesses a specific Bank Group blended
finance mechanism—the PSW—and not other IDA activities. The evaluation
complements the IDA20 PSW Mid-Term Review, which was prepared jointly
by IDA, IFC, and MIGA. The evaluation is part of IEG’s Maximizing Finance
for Development workstream and harmonizes with other IEG evaluations in


                                                                               Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    xxiii
this area of work.

The overall objective of this evaluation is to assess the usage, market de-
velopment potential, and enabling factors of the PSW. This evaluation
assesses how the usage of the PSW has changed from inception to 2023 and
explores two aspects of the PSW that IEG’s early-stage PSW assessment
did not evaluate: its potential market development effects and its enabling
factors—namely, concessionality (for IFC and MIGA) and additionality (for
IFC). Concessionality is the level of subsidy needed for IFC and MIGA to
offer transactions in PSW-eligible countries at market prices. Additionality
is the unique support IFC brings to private investments (on a project basis)
that is not offered by commercial sources of finance (IFC 2018). It includes
financial and nonfinancial additionality.

Evaluation Findings
The findings addressing the first evaluation question center on creat-
ing the conditions for PSW usage and market development. The analysis
focused on PSW usage across the three IDA cycles, its ability to address
constraints on private sector investment, and its potential to contribute to
market development.

After a slow start in IDA18, PSW usage accelerated in IDA19 and IDA20.
PSW funds were underused in IDA18 (with only 53 percent of the initial
$2.5 billion allocation used) but almost entirely used in IDA19 (97 per-
cent of the $1.68 billion allocation) and are on course for full use in IDA20
(36 percent used to date of the $2.5 billion allocation). Uptake of IDA funds,
measured as the percentage of the allocation approved in the first year of
the IDA cycle, has also been quicker in IDA19 and IDA20 (33 percent and
36 percent, respectively) compared with IDA18 (6 percent). Usage has var-
ied by each of the four PSW facilities. Across all three IDA cycles, the BFF
has been the most used, whereas the Risk Mitigation Facility has been the
least used. The allocations for these two facilities were significantly ad-
justed between IDA replenishment cycles, with the BFF allocation growing
from $600 million in IDA18 to a range of $1.2 billion–$1.4 billion in IDA20

                                                                                 Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    xxv
and the Risk Mitigation Facility decreasing from $1 billion in IDA18 to a
range of $150 million–$300 million in IDA20. Usage of the Local Currency
Facility was below its $400 million allocation in IDA18 but increased be-
yond its allocation in IDA19 and is on course for overutilizing its $500 mil-
lion–$650 million allocation for IDA20. Usage of the MIGA Guarantee
Facility (which had an allocation of $500 million in each IDA cycle) has been
relatively stable across all three IDA cycles, with an increase in IDA20.

PSW-supported IFC and MIGA projects aim to address a variety of con-
straints that inhibit private investment in PSW-eligible countries. These
include limited long-term finance, the absence of local currency financing,
market disruptions as a result of exogenous factors (such as the trade col-
lapse and increases in input prices during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
                                                                                                      energy crisis), and barriers to private investment because of poor business

                                                                                                      overall, IFC average annual commitments were lower in the six years after
PSW launch than in the six years before PSW launch, but they dropped by a
significantly smaller margin in countries that received PSW support than in
PSW-eligible countries that did not receive PSW support. IFC commitment
volumes in countries with PSW projects were highest at the onset of the
COVID-19 crisis in FY20, with most projects providing short-term financing
to “keep the private sector going.”

PSW support has also enabled IFC and MIGA to enter new sectors in
PSW-eligible countries. A growing number of PSW-supported projects were
committed in sectors these institutions had never invested in. Examples
of these projects include private equity investment in Ethiopian SMEs and
infrastructure lending to a subnational government in Nigeria. Examples of
MIGA guarantees in new sectors include mobile money projects (Chad, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and Niger), hydropower projects (Nepal and
the Solomon Islands), and solar power projects (Burkina Faso and Malawi).

IFC uses PSW funds to finance the riskiest clients and projects. We
compared the credit ratings by commitment volume for a sample of IFC
PSW projects with those of non-PSW projects committed in the same
sectors of the same countries. We found that, compared with non-PSW
projects, PSW projects have significantly more commitments in the riskiest
credit-rating categories.

otherwise have refrained from. Each US dollar of PSW funds committed
since inception in FY18 has blended $2.7 of additional capital from IFC
and MIGA’s own account and mobilized an additional $2.0 from third-party
public and private sources. By mobilizing capital into projects perceived as
unviable, PSW helps the market generate information about the viability (or
otherwise) of these transactions.

The findings addressing the second evaluation question center on whether
concessionality has enabled PSW projects to occur and whether, along with
financial and nonfinancial additionality, it has created the conditions for
market development. We look at concessionality for both IFC and MIGA and
at financial and nonfinancial additionality for IFC only because MIGA does
not track and measure these features in its projects.

considering that, after six years of operations, total payouts under IDA PSW
guarantees have been only $1 million. The very low payout rate indicates
the potential to leverage PSW capital more, allowing IDA, IFC, and MIGA to
extend more support to PSW-eligible countries.

To optimize leverage, IDA, IFC, and MIGA would benefit from better model-
ing the risks of the PSW facilities based on historical data. Without appro-
priate modeling of the risks, IDA, IFC, and MIGA are unlikely to leverage the
PSW resources optimally. Modeling of the PSW portfolio could be based on
the track record default data of the past six years and other proxy sources
of data for similar risk profile portfolios under different stress scenarios.
Modeling would require (among other things) analyzing the potential
unexpected loss for each PSW facility and various instruments used under
each facility. IFC and MIGA routinely conduct this type of modeling on
their overall portfolios, which could be used as a reference to model
the PSW portfolio.

The Bank Group does not currently produce financial management reports
that calculate the profits and losses of the PSW for IDA, IFC, and MIGA.
Reporting on the PSW is currently fragmented, with no single unit having
a full view of the financial costs and benefits of the PSW operations. Both
management and the Board would benefit from periodic reports on the
profitability and losses of PSW operations for IDA, IFC, and MIGA overall
and for its facilities and instruments. These reports would allow manage-

ment and the Board to understand, for example, to what extent risks move
between IFC or MIGA and IDA.

Nearly three-quarters of PSW projects anticipate a combination of financial
and nonfinancial additionality, but PSW projects underuse nonfinancial
additionalities. This percentage is similar to that of the non-PSW portfolio
in PSW-eligible countries (70 percent) and slightly below that of the IFC
portfolio in middle-income countries, which anticipated both financial and
nonfinancial additionality for 82 percent of investment projects. Financial
additionality is the unique support that IFC brings to a client based on the
features of the financial package offered by IFC. Financing structure, partic-
ularly long-term financing and local currency financing, is the most com-
mon form of financing additionality, and its incidence is similar across PSW

1 | Background and Context
  The Private Sector Window (PSW) is a blended finance mechanism
  that the World Bank Group introduced in 2017 to jumpstart
  private investment in International Development Association (IDA)
  countries and fragile and conflict-affected situations.


  By partially mitigating the risks of the two agencies of the Bank
  Group that provide investment and insurance services to the
  private sector—the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the
  Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)—the PSW makes
  IFC and MIGA transactions possible in IDA countries and fragile and
  conflict-affected situations.


  Key features of PSW projects—concessionality and financial
  and nonfinancial additionality—are expected to enable PSW
  transactions to materialize and to create the conditions for market
  development.


  The evaluation answers two main sets of questions. The first
  inquires about IFC’s and MIGA’s usage of the PSW and early
  evidence on its potential market development effects. The second
  asks whether concessionality and financial and nonfinancial
  additionality have enabled PSW transactions to take place and
  have potential market development effects, whether the IDA
  capital is adequately leveraged, and whether financial reporting on
  the PSW is adequate for decision-making purposes. The evaluation
  examines PSW projects from fiscal years 2018 to 2023.


  We triangulated data from qualitative and quantitative sources
  to answer the evaluation questions. The evaluation methods
  include a literature review; PSW portfolio analysis; an analysis
  of concessionality, capital provisioning, and financial reporting;
  semistructured interviews with IDA, IFC, and MIGA staff, experts,
  and clients; econometric work; and four country case studies. The
  evaluation aims to update the Independent Evaluation Group’s
                                                                        1
      2021 early-stage assessment of the PSW and to complement
      the 20th Replenishment of IDA PSW Mid-Term Review. It is part
      of the Independent Evaluation Group’s Maximizing Finance for
      Development workstream and complements related Independent
      Evaluation Group evaluations.


      This evaluation has limitations. Because only 20 (out of 220) PSW
      projects have closed, it is based on a mix of ex ante and (limited) ex
      post evidence. We assess intermediate outcomes of the PSW, such
      as the impact of the PSW on IFC and MIGA’s ability to enter new
      markets and sectors, but we do not assess the final outcomes or
      impacts of PSW projects.

The private sector creates jobs and prosperity in the poorest countries,
but developing it is challenging. The private sector plays a substantial role
in countries eligible for the Private Sector Window (PSW): International
Development Association (IDA) countries and fragile and conflict-affect-
ed situations (FCS) in IDA. It provides 90 percent of jobs and is the largest
source of income for people living in IDA countries, in turn contributing to
poverty reduction (World Bank 2017). However, attracting private capital and
developing the private sector in low-income and fragile countries is chal-
lenging (World Bank 2016). In many PSW-eligible countries, the domestic
private sector is small, informal, and constrained by a weak macroeconomic
and regulatory environment, infrastructure bottlenecks, and a limited skilled
labor force. High country risks and capital flight concerns make domestic
and international investors reluctant to engage, particularly in FCS, which
also experience security risks. As a result, the ability of PSW-eligible coun-
tries to attract private investment and grow the local private sector remains
limited, constraining their development.

Blended finance, which mixes public development resources with private
funds, can help attract private investment and grow the local private sector
in developing countries, in turn giving them an opportunity to reach several
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Blended finance was created with
the assumption that concessional finance for private sector projects is a
valuable tool that development finance institutions (DFIs)—in cooperation
with donors and other development partners—can use to implement the
Addis Ababa Action Agenda for financing development, including addressing        Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    3
the SDGs and climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. Meeting
these goals requires substantially more financing than official development
assistance and multilateral development banks can provide. The develop-
ment community needed to design approaches that would significantly
increase private capital mobilization and the scale of sustainable private
sector activity. In that context, blended finance emerged as a technique for
deploying public development resources to improve the risk-return profile of
individual DFI investments in developing countries. The goal was to “blend”
these investments with commercial, private financing to show the viability
of projects and build markets that could, over time, attract further commer-
cial capital for development (OECD 2018).

                                                                                                       an additional tool that the World Bank Group could deploy to help address
4	
these challenges, with a specific focus on partially mitigating the risks and
potential losses of IFC and MIGA when they conduct high-risk transactions
in IDA and FCS countries. One feature of PSW projects—concessionality—en-
ables PSW transactions to materialize. Two additional features—financial and
nonfinancial additionality—are expected to create the conditions for market
development. The PSW was created in recognition that expanding support
to the private sector is critical for helping IDA, IFC, and MIGA advance the
IDA special themes—climate change; fragility, conflict, and violence; gender;
governance and institutions; and jobs and economic transformation.1

The PSW comprises four facilities. These are the Blended Finance Facility
(BFF), the Local Currency Facility (LCF), the MIGA Guarantee Facility, and
the Risk Mitigation Facility (RMF). Table 1.1 provides a brief description of
the facilities and their objectives, the instruments they use, and how the
PSW works under each facility. Although each facility has its own design
and focus, they are managed collectively by IDA using a portfolio approach
to reflect the overall objectives of the PSW; each investment is assessed
and approved based on its contribution to broader annual objectives rather
than on a stand-alone basis (World Bank 2017). Individual projects under the
BFF, LCF, and RMF are managed by IFC, whereas MIGA manages the MIGA
Guarantee Facility.

The selection of PSW projects has three eligibility criteria, including the
blended finance principles. The first eligibility criterion is that PSW resourc-

                                                                                   Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    5
es are limited to (i) IDA only, (ii) fragile or conflict-affected IDA gap and
blend countries, and (iii) select subnational areas in countries experiencing
fragility (World Bank 2017). Temporary and transition eligibility was later
granted to select IDA countries. (Appendix A lists the PSW-eligible coun-
tries.) The second eligibility criterion is that PSW-supported activities need
to be aligned with IDA’s poverty focus and special themes, the Bank Group’s
country strategies, and the Bank Group’s approach to supporting private
sector investments and creating markets. The third eligibility criterion is
that projects that use PSW funds (and blended finance projects more broad-
ly) should aim at maximizing additionality and market sustainability while
minimizing concessionality, by following the five blended finance principles
outlined in chapter 1.

market and skills policies (World Bank 2021). IDA can also directly support
the private sector through lines of credit and guarantees backstopping gov-
ernment or state-owned enterprise payment and performance obligations.
IFC provides direct investment in the form of equity, debt, and credit guar-
antees on commercial credit risks, as well as advisory services. In addition,
IFC offers capabilities in project development, structuring, and mobiliza-
tion platforms, along with its global client relationships (World Bank 2018).
MIGA provides guarantees in the form of political risk insurance and credit
enhancement to cover noncommercial risks. Furthermore, MIGA provides
expertise in political risk, structuring, underwriting, pricing, claims man-
agement, reinsurance, and client relationships. All three institutions aim at
direct financing (on the public or private side) and capital mobilization.


Evaluation Questions, Scope, and Methods
The evaluation answers two main sets of questions. The first inquires about
the usage of the PSW funds and about early evidence of its potential market
development effects. The second asks about the PSW’s enabling factors: con-
cessionality (which enables projects to occur in the first place) and financial
and nonfinancial additionality (which enable projects to create the condi-
tions for market development).

»	 Usage and market development. Has the usage of the PSW enabled IFC
   and MIGA to adequately address challenges to private sector investment and
   increase the scope and scale of their portfolios in PSW-eligible countries? Is   Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    9
   there any early evidence that PSW-supported investments are (or are not)
   creating the conditions that lead to market development?

»	 Enabling factors. Has concessionality enabled usage of the PSW? To what
   extent have the PSW subsidies followed the minimum concessionality princi-
   ple (that is, the concessionality embedded in a financing package should not
   be greater than necessary to induce the intended investment)? Is IDA PSW
   capital adequately leveraged to increase usage? Is financial reporting on the
   PSW adequate for decision-making purposes? What types of financial and
   nonfinancial additionality features do PSW projects include? Have these fea-
   tures created the conditions for PSW transactions to have potential market
   development effects?

alignment with IDA special themes (detailed in chapter 2) are based on ex

whereas the findings on financial and nonfinancial additionality are based
mostly on ex ante data. The econometric analysis also has limitations related
to its technical aspects (such as not all PSW projects having a counterfactual
match), but they do not affect the findings of the analysis (see appendix B).


Complementary Assessments: IEG’s 2021 PSW
Early-Stage Assessment and the IDA20 PSW
Mid-Term Review
This evaluation is preceded by a 2021 IEG early-stage assessment of the PSW
and has been developed in parallel with the IDA20 PSW Mid-Term Review.
IEG’s July 2021 report, The World Bank Group’s Experience with the IDA Private
Sector Window: An Early-Stage Assessment (World Bank 2021), provided the
first assessment of the PSW. It focused on the PSW pilot in the IDA18 cycle
and covered the period FY18–20. The report assessed four dimensions of
the PSW. The first was usage (funds committed for clients). The second was
scope and scale—creating or developing new markets or sectors (scope) and
increasing business in PSW-eligible countries and sectors with existing pres-
ence (scale). The third was concessionality, which is needed to make a PSW-
supported investment commercially viable. The fourth was governance (the
decision-making process used for the approval of PSW projects and for the
PSW’s overall strategy). The IDA team has also recently completed the IDA20
PSW Mid-Term Review (DFCII 2023), which covers the IDA18, IDA19, and             Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    13
IDA20 cycles. The IDA20 PSW Mid-Term Review examines the PSW’s usage,
scope and scale additionality, subsidy levels (concessionality), and lessons
for operational enhancement (governance) of the PSW.

The findings of IEG’s 2021 early-stage assessment of the PSW (World Bank
2021) were mixed. The assessment found that, during the IDA18 cycle, the
use of the PSW was $1.4 billion, well below the originally allocated amount
of $2.5 billion, and that much of it was driven by the Bank Group’s COVID-19
response. It also found that IFC commitments and MIGA guarantees in
PSW-eligible countries remained relatively stable compared with levels
before the introduction of the PSW but that the PSW had some positive ef-
fects in allowing the two institutions to enter new markets and sectors. The

2 | Private Sector Window Usage
   and Market Development
   Potential

  Private Sector Window (PSW) funds were underused in the 18th
  Replenishment of the International Development Association
  (IDA18) but almost entirely used in IDA19 and are on course for full
  use in IDA20. Uptake of IDA funds has accelerated in IDA19 and
  IDA20, from 6 percent approved funds in the first year of IDA18
  to more than 30 percent in the other two cycles. Usage has been
  strongest for the Blended Finance Facility and weakest for the Risk
  Mitigation Facility. Usage of the Local Currency Facility is growing,
  and usage of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
  Guarantee Facility is stable.


  Although non-PSW projects in eligible countries aim to address
  mostly one constraint on private sector investment in IDA countries
  and fragile and conflict-affected situations—lack of long-term
  finance—PSW projects aim to address a variety of constraints
  by providing (i) local currency financing in the absence of a local
  currency to US dollar swap market; (ii) long-term finance in countries
  where it is not available; (iii) emergency funding that local financial
  institutions would not be able to provide to address disruptions
  as a result of exogenous factors (such as the trade collapse and
  increases in input prices during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
  energy crisis); and (iv) guarantees to operate in an unfavorable
  business environment (for example, insurance against political risks).


  The PSW has enabled the International Finance Corporation to
  commit a higher investment volume in PSW-eligible countries than
  it would have without PSW support. The PSW has also enabled the
  International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment
  Guarantee Agency to enter new countries and invest in new sectors
  (for example, mobile money and equity funding for small and
  medium enterprises) in PSW-eligible countries.
                                                                            17
       PSW projects mobilized third-party private and public capital,
       although, as expected, to a lesser extent than non-PSW projects
       in IDA countries and projects in middle-income countries, given
       their higher risks. Mobilization of private capital in IDA countries
       and fragile and conflict-affected situations is important to help the
       market generate information about the viability of transactions.


       PSW projects are ex ante broadly aligned with the IDA special
       themes. However, not all of them have objectives related to jobs
       and economic transformation, as envisioned at the time the
       PSW was created, and climate and gender objectives are
       unevenly covered.
18  
This chapter covers several interrelated aspects of the PSW: (i) its us-
age, (ii) its ability to address constraints on private investment, and (iii) its
potential to create the conditions for market development and to achieve
broader development outcomes. First, we measure the PSW usage against
the initial PSW allocations for the three IDA replenishment cycles (IDA18,
IDA19, and IDA20) since the PSW’s inception in FY17. Usage is a neces-
sary but not sufficient condition for the PSW to achieve its ultimate goals
of developing markets, helping eligible countries address the IDA special
themes, and making progress toward the SDGs. Thus, the second part of the
chapter looks at whether the PSW aims to address key constraints on private
investment and whether PSW projects have enabled IFC and MIGA to create
the conditions to develop markets in PSW-eligible countries. We do so by
examining whether IFC and MIGA have improved the scope (creating, devel-
oping, or sustaining new markets and sectors) and scale (increasing business
in countries and sectors) of their investments and by looking at whether
the PSW has mobilized third-party private capital in risky transactions. The
chapter closes with a brief assessment of whether PSW transactions are
aligned with the IDA special themes and the SDGs.

The analysis of PSW usage and market development potential is based on
both ex ante and ex post data. Although, as mentioned in chapter 1, we do
not have sufficient numbers of closed PSW projects and PSW projects that
IEG evaluated to conduct a full result assessment, our findings are based


                                                                                    Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    19
on analysis of both ex ante and ex post data. We extract ex ante data from
project approval documents. Ex ante analysis excludes information on the
execution or achievement of results (for example, no indication of whether a
transaction has materialized or on the realization of expected development
outcomes). We extract ex post data from project supervision documents or
case studies. This captures data on PSW transactions that have taken place
and achieved intermediate development outcomes—for example, PSW
transactions that have allowed IFC and MIGA to invest in new countries and
sectors. The usage and the scope and scale analysis are based, by and large,
on ex post portfolio data, as 86 percent of the PSW projects have been com-
mitted (190 of 220), 92 percent of which (175 of the 190 committed projects)
have either disbursed (101 investments) or have provided guarantees that
have been issued (45 guarantees for IFC and 29 guarantees for MIGA). The

Note: IDA19 received an initial allocation of US$2.5 billion, meant initially for three years. However, IDA
shortened the cycle to two years because of COVID-19, and we have adjusted the allocation figures
accordingly. The IDA20 allocation is for FY23–25, but the figure shows IDA20 approvals for FY23 only.
FY = fiscal year; IDA18 = 18th Replenishment of the International Development Association; PSW =
Private Sector Window.


Usage varies by PSW facility, and allocations to PSW facilities have been
adjusted based on use in the previous cycles. The BFF has been overused in
each of the three IDA cycles, whereas RMF was used for only one project in
the IDA18 cycle with no further usage in IDA19 and IDA20 (figure 2.2). As a
result, the share of PSW funds allocated to the BFF has increased progres-

a year) in IDA18 to a range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion per three-year cycle
(or $400 million to $500 million a year) in IDA20. In contrast, allocations for
RMF have decreased substantially (from $1 billion during IDA18 to a range of
$150 million to $300 million in IDA20). Utilization of the LCF was below allo-
cation in IDA18 but increased beyond allocation in IDA19 and is headed to-
ward overuse in IDA20. Approvals for LCF, which totaled $219 million in the
three-year IDA18 cycle, jumped to $565 million in the two-year IDA19 cycle
and have already reached $206 million in the first year of IDA20. Allocations
for the MIGA Guarantee Facility have remained the same across all three IDA
cycles ($500 million per three-year cycle or $167 million annually). Usage

infrastructure projects offered by RMF are similar to the IDA’s partial risk
guarantees (which, unlike RMF, also cover sovereign risk) and the political
risk insurance offered by MIGA.

Across all three IDA cycles, PSW projects concentrate on the finance indus-
try group for IFC and on infrastructure for MIGA. Finance industry group
projects account for 70 percent of approvals (table 2.1) of the three facilities
managed by IFC as of the end of FY23. This concentration reflects the high
demand for short-term finance during the COVID-19 crisis and the scarcity
of local currency financing throughout all three IDA cycles. Eighty percent of
PSW MIGA projects are in infrastructure.

How the PSW Addresses Absent Local Currency and
Long-Term Finance

There is no local currency to US dollar swap market in many PSW-eligible
countries because of high country risk, including macroeconomic or political
uncertainty. The absence of a local currency swap market stalls or disrupts
the forward foreign exchange hedging markets, making hedging expensive
or impossible. This absence has made it difficult for financial institutions
to raise funds in local currency, leading them to opt for foreign currency
loans, which expose them—and their clients—to foreign exchange risks and
increase borrowing costs. The nascent development of many PSW-eligible
countries also means there is often a lack of local market liquidity for lend-
ing, particularly (but not only) at longer tenors. As a result, the private finan-
cial sector in these countries cannot provide sufficient credit denominated
in local currency.

How the PSW Addresses Market Disruptions because
of Exogenous Factors
PSW-eligible countries can be strongly affected by market disruptions be-
cause of exogenous factors. Exogenous factors include, for example, the
recent global COVID-19 pandemic, food, and energy crises. These disrup-
tions can cause a mismatch between the supply and demand for financing,
potentially disrupting or destroying existing markets. Global crises and their
consequences are likely to affect PSW-eligible countries more than mid-
dle-income countries (MICs) because governments and private firms in PSW-
eligible countries do not have sufficient resources to cope during these times.

To address these challenges, PSW projects have provided short-term financ-
ing to help private companies circumvent the liquidity crunch. Examples in-
clude the Working Capital Solutions Crisis Response Facility in countries such
as Cambodia, Nigeria, and Tanzania, which benefited from the pooled first-
loss guarantee (PFLG) product offering provided by the IDA PSW BFF. The
Base of the Pyramid (BOP) platform is another example of a crisis instrument
that used the PSW facilities to provide finance to private companies, includ-
ing MSMEs, in PSW-eligible countries. This platform was set up under the IFC
COVID-19 Facility to reach MSMEs in more fragile markets, with three-year
liquidity support delivered through IFC client banks and microfinance insti-
tutions. It aimed to “keep the private sector going” while the COVID-19 crisis


                                                                                  Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    27
severely disrupted markets. The platform has been extended twice, with the
latest extension allowing up to five-year tenors and reducing the first-loss
level from 40 percent to 30 percent. A snapshot of projects in the BOP plat-
form’s portfolio (as of June 2023) shows that the platform has been successful
in helping IFC reach firms in PSW-eligible countries by deploying both the
PSW BFF through PFLG (27 projects) and the PSW LCF (19 projects).


How the PSW Addresses Unfavorable Business
Environments
An unfavorable business environment is characterized by poor macroeco-
nomic policies and a lack of—or inappropriate—legal and regulatory frame-
works for the economy or specific industries. Examples of constraining
factors in the business environment include macroeconomic instability,

                                                                                                       such as market entry barriers in network or contestable sectors (for example,
                                                                                                       energy, telecom, and agriculture)—often compound their disruptive effects.

Scaling Up Engagement for Market Development in
PSW-Eligible Markets
PSW projects have, ex ante, the potential to unlock markets. IFC evaluates
the ex ante market impacts of its projects using the Anticipated Impact
Measurement and Monitoring framework. This framework assigns projects
a market potential rating that increases from “marginal” to “very strong”
based on the degree to which projects deliver effects that have the potential
to address important market gaps in undeveloped markets. A comparison
of Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring scores for a sample
of PSW and non-PSW projects in the same sectors and countries shows
that the share of projects with “strong” or “very strong” market potential
is slightly higher in PSW projects (83 percent for PSW projects compared
with 75 percent of non-PSW; figure 2.4). PSW projects often target
underresourced markets and groups (for example, women or microfinance
institutions) and enable investments in unexplored sectors. One example
of a PSW project with a “very strong” market potential is a project in
Tanzania that addresses market barriers discouraging financial institutions
from serving women-led MSMEs. This project financed the first publicly
placed gender bond issued by the largest bank in the country. It is expected


                                                                                Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    29

PSW support (figure 2.6).4 The stark difference remains when excluding FY13
(an apparent outlier), with decreases of 16 percent in countries that received
PSW support and 55 percent in countries that did not receive PSW support.
IFC commitment volumes in countries with PSW projects increased especial-
ly sharply at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis in FY20. Most projects aimed
at addressing the COVID-19 crisis by providing short-term financing to
“keep the private sector going.” As the effects of the COVID-19 crisis start-
ed to fade, a large share of PSW projects provided local currency financing,
and the tenures of PSW interventions extended. This pattern is consistent

PSW support has enabled IFC and MIGA to enter new sectors in PSW-eligible
countries.6 A growing number of PSW-supported projects were committed in
sectors in which these institutions had not invested before PSW (figure 2.8).
Overall, 17 percent of all PSW projects committed and 65 percent of MIGA
guarantees executed between FY18 and FY23 were deployed in such new
sectors. Examples of these projects include private equity investment in
Ethiopian SMEs in FY19, thermal power generation projects in Afghanistan
in FY20, infrastructure lending to a subnational government in Nigeria
in FY22, investment in wholesale open-access fiber operation in Togo in
FY22, and tourism infrastructure projects in Sudan in FY23. Examples of
MIGA guarantees in new sectors are mobile money projects in Chad, the

PSW mobilizes third-party capital in transactions that investors might
otherwise have refrained from. Each US dollar of PSW funds committed
since inception in FY18 has blended $2.7 of additional capital from IFC
and MIGA’s own account and mobilized an additional $2.0 from third-party
public and private sources (table 2.2).8 Data also show that each US dollar of
the institution’s own account committed mobilizes less third-party private
capital in PSW-financed projects ($0.6) than in non-PSW projects ($1.4)
in the same sector of the same countries (table 2.2). This reflects private
investors’ reluctance to invest in PSW-financed transactions, which are
perceived to be highly risky. By mobilizing capital into projects perceived as
unviable, PSW helps the market generate information about these transac-
tions’ potential viability.

transformation—with the expectation that PSW projects would contribute
to it (World Bank 2017). All 35 (nonconfidential) PSW projects in the four
country case studies that we analyzed (Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Nigeria, and
Tanzania) addressed one or more IDA special themes in their ex ante ap-
proval documents (table 2.3).10 Most IFC projects aim at addressing fragility
and creating jobs and transforming economies, whereas MIGA projects aim
mostly at addressing fragility and climate change. A PSW project in Tanzania
exemplifies how PSW projects aim to address broad development objectives.
IFC provided funds to a major Tanzanian financial institution to on-lend to
MSMEs to support creating a conducive environment for economic recovery
and growth from the pandemic. It aimed to stimulate economic activity by
ensuring that these enterprises could continue their operations during the
crisis. This, in turn, was expected to contribute to job retention, income gen-
eration, and overall economic stability. The project’s market creation aspect
aligns with the broader goal of positioning the private sector for postpan-
demic recovery and reducing the time it takes for vulnerable populations to
regain income-earning opportunities.

     Three countries eligible for the Private Sector Window (PSW; Eritrea, the Syrian Arab
Republic, and Zimbabwe) are not included in this count of 67 PSW-eligible countries.
According to the list of PSW-eligible countries, these countries are tagged as “inactive”—that
is, they have no active International Development Association (IDA) financing because of
protracted nonaccrual status.

     These 26 countries are the Central African Republic, the Comoros, the Republic of Congo,
Djibouti, Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Kiribati,
Lesotho, Malawi, Maldives, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Papua
New Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, the Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sudan,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. These 26 countries collectively account for 7 percent of the total
GDP of all 67 PSW-eligible countries.

     “New sectors” refers to sectors (at the secondary sectoral classification level) that the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) had never invested in within a specific PSW-eligible country before PSW.

     This estimate is based on the subset of the IFC and MIGA PSW portfolio for which we have
data on capital mobilization, but it is broadly consistent with the estimates reported in the
20th Replenishment of IDA (IDA20) PSW Mid-Term Review.

     For the IDA20 cycle, Human Development was added, the Governance and Institutions
theme was dropped, and the other four special themes remained the same. We did not analyze
the Human Development theme, which was added only in IDA20, because only one year has
passed in this cycle.

10 
      For our review, we counted a project as addressing a specific special theme if it was men-
tioned in the project description or development impact section in Board approval documents
or there was any indicator tracked that was related to the special theme.

   (PSW) concessionality enables PSW projects to materialize.
   Without it, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the
   Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency could not execute high-
   risk transactions in PSW-eligible countries because their cost of
   risk would make their pricing uneconomical for local borrowers.


   PSW projects meet the minimum concessionality principle, which
   mandates that IDA concessionality should not be greater than
   necessary to induce the intended investment and ensures that IFC
   and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency do not distort
   markets.


   The IDA capital allocated to the PSW is underleveraged. Currently,
   IDA sets aside capital for the maximum potential loss that could
   occur—an extremely conservative capital reserve.


   Periodic reports on the profits and losses of IDA, IFC, and the
   Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency for the PSW overall and
   for its facilities and instruments are currently not available.


   Nearly three-quarters of PSW projects anticipate a combination
   of financial and nonfinancial additionalities. Financing structure,
   particularly long-term and local currency financing, is the most
   common form of anticipated financial additionality in PSW projects.
   Financing innovation is also high.


   IFC PSW projects underuse nonfinancial additionalities, including
   standard setting, noncommercial risk mitigation, catalyzing policy
   or regulatory changes, and (to a lesser extent) knowledge and
   capacity building.

42	
is determined by its cost of funds, operations, risk, and capital. Similarly,
MIGA’s pricing is determined by its cost of claims, operations, risk, and
capital. For both IFC and MIGA, the cost of risk and capital allocations are
dramatically higher in IDA countries because of their high risk ratings. Our
estimates indicate that the pricing of IFC and MIGA transactions without
IDA PSW would be 5–30 percentage points higher (depending on the client
and the country) than with IDA PSW. Although risk mitigation instruments,
such as collateral, guarantees, or credit insurance, could contribute to reduc-
ing IFC’s and MIGA’s pricing, these mitigation instruments are rarely avail-
able in PSW-eligible countries. Moreover, they are too expensive to enable
IFC or MIGA to meet market rates for the transactions they aim to support
(for example, banks targeting SMEs or companies entering new sectors). (See
appendix D for more details on concessionality.)

Interviews with clients and with IFC, MIGA, and IDA staff confirm that,
without the IDA PSW concessionality, IFC and MIGA could not execute most
transactions they currently pursue through PSW projects. Evidence from case
studies reveals that, in 15 out of 17 PSW projects examined across Burkina
Faso, Cambodia, Nigeria, and Tanzania, IFC would not have been able to
price the transactions at a level affordable for clients or for the projects to be
viable without PSW support, given the prevailing risks in these countries. For
the other two projects (both under the Working Capital Solutions Facility as
part of IFC’s COVID-19 emergency response), the interviewees indicated that


                                                                                     Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    43
the transactions might have gone ahead without the PSW but would have
been structured differently (for example, shorter terms, higher collateral, or
guarantees required to proceed). One interview in Nigeria reported that IFC
had identified a project in FY19, but the project was put on hold after the
credit rating went down two notches because of political instability in the
country. The deal was eventually committed, with PSW support, in FY21, af-
ter Nigeria became PSW eligible. An interview in Tanzania reported that the
client rejected a deal that did not secure PSW funding. Clients mentioned
that—even when IFC and MIGA provide PSW (concessional) transactions—
their prices are often above those of local competitors. Interviews with cli-
ents, staff, and experts also indicated that operating without concessionality
may still allow IFC and MIGA to provide financing to the higher-rated enter-
prises in PSW-eligible countries. Operating without concessionality would,

money. If the currency declines in value, IDA loses money, but IFC is protect-
ed. The MIGA Guarantee Facility uses FLGs and risk participation to bring
down the cost of noncommercial political risk insurance to private sector
lenders and investors funding projects in IDA countries, mostly in infra-
structure. FLGs and risk participation also bring down the loss potential on
the overall MIGA insurance policy, allowing MIGA to buy reinsurance from
major reinsurance companies, effectively crowding these companies into
IDA markets (see appendix D).

IFC and MIGA pay IDA for risk mitigation at concessional rates reported to
the Board. On FLGs and PFLGs, IFC and MIGA pay IDA a percentage of their
spread equal to the loss coverage. For example, on the first two rounds of
the BOP platform, IFC paid IDA 40 percent of its spread on the IDA PSW-
supported loans in the BOP platform portfolio in exchange for a 40 percent
pooled first-loss coverage offered by IDA. For the LCF, IFC generally pays
IDA a below-market swap rate (which represents IFC’s funding cost), agreed
on each transaction, while retaining the credit spread component (as IFC
retains the credit risk on LCF transactions). The concession size varies by
instrument and country, depending on the difference between the commer-
cial price and the IDA price required to enable IFC and MIGA to price their
transactions at market.


Key Findings on Concessionality

IFC and MIGA follow the minimum concessionality principle. PSW projects
meet the minimum concessionality principle (that is, they are not greater
than necessary to induce the intended investment and do not distort the
markets). Consistent with IEG’s 2021 early-stage assessment of the PSW, we
found that IFC and MIGA follow a rigorous governance process to ensure
that each approved transaction meets the minimum concessionality princi-
ple requirement. We confirmed that prices do not distort markets based on
our review of project and blended finance approval documents, pricing doc-
uments, and evidence from case studies. Financing terms are calculated and
documented using IFC’s and MIGA’s pricing models or valuation models. The
prices are disclosed in the investment review memos (with comparables),
approved in the concept endorsement and investment review meetings, and
reviewed by the Blended Finance Committee and an IDA representative.

whole IDA allocation to the IDA PSW could be lost and that none would be
recovered through collateral or insolvency procedures. This highly conser-
vative treatment might have been justified at the time when the IDA PSW
was set up (as a pilot), given the lack of historical data on PSW transactions.
However, after six years of operations, total payouts under guarantees have
been only $1 million, or less than 1 percent of the total exposure. This lack
of payouts indicates the potential to leverage PSW funds more, allowing IDA,
IFC, and MIGA to extend more support to PSW-eligible countries.

Neither IDA nor IFC nor MIGA are modeling the risks of the PSW facilities
based on historical data. Different facilities have very different risk and
return profiles. For example, the LCF is exposed to high risks of local curren-
cy devaluations that can quickly and significantly affect the PSW loss rates
when devaluations occur. These devaluation events are largely outside of
IFC’s and IDA’s control. FLGs, conversely, take credit risk that is much less
volatile and that can be effectively managed by working with clients—for
example, IFC can use loan covenants to reduce exposure or restructure fa-
cilities in times of stress, reducing the amount of potential first loss through
good portfolio management. For these reasons, the mix of IDA PSW prod-
ucts and the diversification (or concentration) of foreign exchange risks and
credit risks can have a large impact on the financial performance of the PSW.
This risk suggests that there may be better ways to manage the overall PSW
facility allocations and distribution. Modeling the probability of default and


                                                                                   Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    47
the loss given default of the PSW portfolio, the effects of foreign exchange
rate movements, and the results of PSW operations is necessary to under-
stand the best way to manage IDA’s capital allocations and facility mix and
to assess whether and how the PSW could be further leveraged. Since IFC
and MIGA routinely conduct modeling on their overall portfolios, they could
conduct it to get a PSW view. Modeling of the PSW portfolio could be based
on the track record default data of the past six years and other proxy sources
of data for similar risk profile portfolios under different stress scenarios.

Modeling the PSW portfolio and effectively managing PSW capital require
analyzing the unexpected loss potential of each PSW facility and the in-
struments used under each facility. Unexpected loss is a risk calculation
that is used to determine how much capital a financial institution needs to
reserve to cover potential unexpected losses and still maintain its rating. As

and then discuss the specific types of financial and nonfinancial additional-
ity of PSW projects, comparing them with similar non-PSW projects in IDA
countries and with (non-PSW) projects in MICs. The analysis relies on IFC
additionality claims (anticipated or ex ante additionality) in PSW projects’
approval documents.

IFC defines additionality as the unique contribution that it brings to a pri-
vate investment project that is typically not offered by commercial sources
of finance (IFC 2018). Additionality is a threshold condition for a project’s
approval and, as such, is assessed at the project level. Financial addition-
ality is the unique support that IFC brings to a client based on the features
of the financial package offered, including the financing structure (such as
longer tenors and provision of local currency financing), resource mobiliza-
tion (from the private sector or other DFIs), or innovative financing (such
as derivatives and green bonds). Nonfinancial additionality relates to the
deployment of knowledge and standards—for example, capacity building
to help financial institutions assess the credit risks of MSMEs or to help
IFC clients improve their environmental and social or industrial standards.
Table 3.1 defines the various types of financial and nonfinancial addition-
ality. A single project can anticipate more than one form of additionality—
for example, by IFC offering both long tenor and resource mobilization or
capacity building together with local currency financing to financial institu-
tions (World Bank 2022b).

Anticipated Financial Additionalities
Financing structure is the most common anticipated additionality of IFC
projects in the PSW, non-PSW, and MIC portfolios. Sixty-six percent of
PSW projects anticipated financing structure additionality compared with
70 percent of the MIC portfolio and 73 percent of non-PSW projects in
PSW-eligible countries (figure 3.1). The types of financing structure addi-
tionality described in the approval documents of PSW projects align with the
challenges to private sector investment that PSW funding intends to tackle
(namely, lack of long-term funding and lack of local currency financing).
Provision of long-term funding and local currency financing, driven by the                             Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    51
use of the PSW LCF, is predominant.

SMEs. The project was processed under the Small Loan Guarantee Program,
which uses a pooled first-loss structure provided by the IDA PSW BFF. The
project consists of an unfunded risk-sharing facility of up to $10 million
equivalent in local currency, which guarantees 50 percent of an up to
$20 million equivalent portfolio of eligible SME and women-owned SME fa-
cilities extended by the local bank. IFC considered this structure innovative
in Nigeria because IFC’s risk-sharing facility is flexible regarding the types
of loans and facilities that can be included in the portfolio (such as working
capital loans and longer-tenured loans). Hence, it can help meet the wide
range of SME financing needs more effectively than other financing available
in the local market.

Mobilization expectations in the PSW portfolios are lower than in non-PSW
IDA projects but higher than in MICs. IFC claims resource mobilization addi-
tionality when IFC plays a direct and verifiable role in mobilizing financing
from other public or private investors. Consistent with the (ex post) findings
of chapter 2 and the risk profile of PSW transactions, anticipated resource
mobilization additionality claims are less common in PSW than in non-PSW
portfolios in IDA countries (19 percent compared with 34 percent, respec-
tively). They are, however, still above those in MICs (12 percent).

alities across PSW, non-PSW, and MIC portfolios, some particularities stand
out. The first is that there is almost no difference in knowledge and capacity
building across the three portfolios (figure 3.2). The second is that there are
low levels of standard-setting additionality in the (PSW and non-PSW) port-
folios of PSW-eligible countries. The third is that the PSW portfolio has the
lowest incidence of noncommercial risk mitigation among the three. Finally,
there is a very low incidence of catalyzing regulatory reforms (which is in
line with the rest of the IFC portfolio).

additionality signals IFC’s expectations that its presence in the project will
comfort clients and other investors to mitigate noncommercial risks, such as
country, regulatory, or political risks, because of IFC’s and the Bank Group’s
reputation in the market. The ultimate expected outcome of noncommer-
cial risk mitigation is that IFC’s presence would crowd in other investors
who will contribute to or replicate the project on their own (or with other
partners). The reasons for this low additionality are unclear and should be
further investigated. They could range from IFC not expecting other inves-
tors to follow, given the high-risk profile of the markets and projects, to IFC
underreporting this additionality in approval documents.

The IFC PSW portfolio also underuses catalyzing policy or regulatory change
additionality. This additionality signals that IFC is the first investor to test
a new or “untested” policy, regulatory, or legal framework, opening the door
for others to follow. Yet, the presence of this additionality in PSW projects
is negligible, as it is in the rest of the portfolio. This low incidence of cata-
lyzing policy or regulatory change additionality could be either because the
enabling environment is not ready for private sector investment, because
IFC is not proactively monitoring relevant regulatory changes that open the
door for investment, or because it is not seeking these types of interventions

        Recommendations


Conclusions
The usage of PSW funds has increased over the IDA cycles, and
allocations to the PSW facilities have been adjusted based on usage.
PSW funds were underused in IDA18 (with only 53 percent of the initial
$2.5 billion allocation used) but almost entirely used in IDA19 (97 percent
of the $1.68 billion allocation) and are on course for full use in IDA20
(36 percent used to date of the $2.5 billion allocation). The uptake of IDA
funds has also accelerated in IDA19 and IDA20. Usage has been strongest for
the BFF and weakest for RMF. In each IDA cycle, allocations to PSW facilities
have been adjusted based on use in the previous cycles.

PSW projects address a variety of challenges to private sector investment
and have enabled IFC and MIGA to increase their engagements and mobilize
capital. The constraints on private sector investment addressed by PSW
projects include lack of long-term finance and local currency financing;
disruptions as a result of exogenous factors, such as the COVID-19
pandemic and the energy and food crises; and unfavorable business
environments because of macroeconomic instability, political risks, and
inadequate regulatory and legal frameworks. The PSW has enabled IFC and
MIGA to increase their investments in countries and sectors in which they
were already active and to enter new ones. Statistical evidence indicates
that the scale-up would not have happened without PSW funds and that
the PSW mitigated the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on IFC and MIGA’s
financing in eligible countries. PSW projects mobilized third-party private
and public capital, helping the market generate information about the
viability of transactions.

Concessionality enabled PSW projects to materialize, and the IDA PSW
meets the minimum concessionality principle. Without the IDA PSW, IFC
and MIGA could not execute high-risk projects in PSW-eligible countries
                                                                                57

                                                                                                       local borrowers. The IDA PSW does not provide more than the minimum
                                                                                                       concessionality necessary to induce the intended investment; thus, it meets
                                                                                                       the minimum concessionality principle and does not distort markets.

      PSW to Bank Group management and the Board. IDA, IFC, and MIGA
      should develop annual financial management reports that show their
      profits and losses for PSW activities—per agency, per facility, and by
      instrument—so that the effects of risk transfers among the three agencies
      can be clearly tracked. This reporting can be tied into IFC’s and MIGA’s
      existing risk reporting systems that cover all projects.


Issues for Further Consideration
This evaluation uncovered several areas that IDA, IFC, and MIGA or IEG
could consider in their future assessments. This IEG interim assessment
is focused on specific aspects of the IDA PSW, and it was produced under
a tight timeline to inform the December 2023 IDA midterm discussions.
Although this evaluation broadened and deepened the analysis conducted
in IEG’s FY21 PSW early-stage assessment, it also uncovered several aspects
that could be further explored in the future to exploit the full potential
of the PSW to develop markets in PSW-eligible countries and to identify
lessons that could be useful for blended finance interventions at large.
Some of these topics include the following: (i) assessing the optimal size
of the PSW, including the optimal allocation of IDA funds between public
sector and PSW interventions and the optimal allocation to each PSW
facility and to various instruments supported by the PSW; (ii) assessing the


                                                                                  Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    59
costs and benefits and the feasibility of extending the PSW concessions to
IFC and MIGA final clients with a view to increasing capital mobilization;
(iii) assessing whether the PSW has contributed to helping IFC and MIGA
develop markets and achieve broad development outcomes, including an
analysis of the outcomes of the various facilities and of different types
of IFC and MIGA instruments (this can be done only after several PSW
projects have been completed and validated) and an analysis of PSW use
versus private capital mobilized over time; and (iv) assessing the use and
market development effects of the PSW transactions in specific sectors,
including the effectiveness of sector-level strategic approaches, and whether

Note: Four additional countries (Bhutan, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Uzbekistan) were
Private Sector Window–eligible in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 but not in fiscal year 2023. AFR
= Africa; EAP = East Asia and Pacific; ECA = Europe and Central Asia; FCS = fragile and conflict-affected
situations; IDA = International Development Association; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; MENA
= Middle East and North Africa; MIGA = Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency; PDR = People’s
Democratic Republic; PSW = Private Sector Window; SAR = South Asia.

a. Temporary eligibility until the end of 2023.
b. Private Sector Window–eligible until the end of the 20th Replenishment of IDA because of transition
from IDA-only to Gap status.
c. Private Sector Window–eligible until the end of the 20th Replenishment of IDA because of change in
FCS status.
d. No active IDA financing because of protracted nonaccrual status.

                                                                                                        To answer the first question, the team theorized a priori that the level of
                                                                                                        IFC’s investment in a given country is a function of three main factors: the
68	
country’s income level, its region, and the status of PSW usage in that coun-
try. A country’s income level reflects the size of its economy, which in turn is
a determinant of its ability to support “bankable” deals (smaller economies
are likely to support fewer and smaller bankable deals and vice versa). A
country’s region is also expected to influence the level of IFC investment be-
cause some regions may get more attention than others in the institution’s
strategic priorities.

Based on this theoretical expectation, the evaluation team modeled IFC
investment volume (in a log-transformed form) as a function of PSW usage,
controlling for income levels and regions. This modeling used a staggered
difference-in-difference technique, the choice of which was informed by the
following factors:

  1.	 As of the end of FY23, IFC has used PSW to invest in some PSW-eligible
      countries (one may think of this as the “treatment” group), whereas it
      has not used it in other PSW-eligible countries (the “comparison” group).

  2.	 There is variation in treatment timing. That is, countries were first
      “exposed” to PSW support at different times.

  3.	 There are yearly “pretreatment” and “posttreatment” data for all countries
      from FY57 to FY23 (although the analysis used data only for the six-year
      period before and after PSW launch; that is, FY12 to FY23).



                                                                                   Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    69
  4.	 IFC’s investment volumes in both “treatment” and “comparison” groups
      followed a relatively parallel pattern before PSW rollout in FY18 (see
      figure 2.6), suggesting that “parallel trends” hold. In other words, it is
      reasonable to assume that IFC commitment volumes in the treatment
      and comparison groups were following similar trends before the PSW
      and would have continued to do the same afterward had PSW not
      been introduced.

In staggered treatment settings (such as that described in this appendix), a
two-way fixed effects estimation is usually the standard estimation model of
choice. However, recent advances in the econometrics literature have shown
that the two-way fixed effects model can produce biased estimates if treat-
ment effects are heterogeneous across cross-sectional and temporal units
(Goodman-Bacon 2021). In the present setting, this means that if the effect
                                                                                                        of PSW on IFC investment volumes is different across countries and across
                                                                                                        time (and it is reasonable to expect that this is the case), the two-way fixed
                                                                                                        effects model may give biased estimates. When such a heterogeneous treat-
                                                                                                        ment effect exists, an alternative approach in the literature is the estimation

To answer the second question (has PSW enabled IFC to increase the scope
of its investments in PSW-eligible countries?), the evaluation compared PSW
and non-PSW portfolios along several measures, such as client risk rating, ex
ante Anticipated Impact Measurement and Monitoring scores, and private
capital mobilization. For this exercise, we used a matching technique and,
where applicable, regression. The rationale for matching is that the PSW
and non-PSW portfolios, if unmatched, differ along several characteristics
that may confound the aforementioned comparison. For example, PSW and
non-PSW projects may differ systematically in terms of their countries and
sectors (and other possible factors), and these differences may account for
any variation in the outcome measures of interest observed between PSW

and non-PSW portfolios.

To mitigate this possible confounding, we used matching to obtain subsets
of PSW and non-PSW portfolios that are “balanced” in terms of their distri-
butions of two main anticipated confounding variables: country and sector.
The matching was performed using the Coarsened Exact Matching module in
Stata. Before matching, the unbalanced sample consisted of 138 PSW proj-
ects and 1,645 non-PSW projects and had a multivariate L1 statistic of 0.45.1
After matching, the matched sample contained 97 PSW projects and 231
non-PSW projects, and the multivariate L1 statistic was 1.065 × 10–15.

Using the matched sample, we then used ordinary least squares regression
(where the outcome of interest is numeric) to estimate the magnitude and
statistical significance of the differences in the outcome measures between

                                                                                                        we included weights in the regression to equalize the number of PSW and

staggered difference-in-difference analysis requires that parallel trends hold
across treated cohorts (groups of countries that received their first PSW-
supported investment in the same years), conditional on income level and
region. Although the trends in figure 2.6 do suggest that parallel trends hold
in the sample of treated versus comparison countries, the evaluation team
is unable to verify, statistically or visually, the validity of this assumption
across treated cohorts. Second, the matching technique helps the team com-
pare PSW and non-PSW projects that are reliably similar. However, the cost
of this matching exercise is that unmatched PSW projects are excluded from
the analysis. Unmatched PSW projects may have systematically different

Review of project pricing and interviews with IDA, IFC, and MIGA staff on
concessionality. The IFC-IDA PSW approval process entails calculating ex-
plicit risk coverage in terms of loss guarantees and applying this to the client
transaction pricing. We assessed how IFC and IDA, individually and jointly,
calculate risks and risk offsets, both on an individual project basis and on
a pooled risk basis. To do this, we looked at IFC’s loss given default calcu-
lations and the risk offset provided by IDA guarantees. We reviewed IFC’s
guidelines and standardized “calculator” for conducting these calculations
and MIGA’s process for estimating the concessionality of MIGA Guarantee
Facility projects. We also interviewed IFC and MIGA staff involved in manag-
ing the guidelines and calculator (such as blended finance unit staff at IFC)
and staff working at the World Bank Treasury to gauge the effect of the PSW
concessions on the portfolios of the three institutions. These reviews of pric-
ing and interviews with blended finance and treasury staff, along with the
portfolio review and analysis, are the main methods that we used to estab-
lish the findings on concessionality in chapter 3.

The evaluation has several limitations. As only 20 (out of 220) PSW proj-
ects have closed, and none have been independently evaluated or validated
by the Independent Evaluation Group, the evaluation is based on a mix of
ex ante and (when available) ex post evidence. Ex post evidence is partial
because it is based on case studies, portfolio supervision documents, and
interviews. Our analysis of development outcomes is limited to intermediate

outcomes. We have been able to assess, for example, the impact of the PSW
on IFC’s and MIGA’s ability to enter new markets and sectors, expand their
presence in existing markets, and mobilize third-party capital. We were,
however, unable to assess the development outcomes and impacts of the
PSW projects, which limits the scope of the analysis. Country case studies,
which were selected based on several criteria, such as the high number of
PSW projects (35 PSW projects in total in the four case study countries were
reviewed) and presence of counterfactual projects (appendix B provides
further details), offer some insights into the early impacts of PSW projects.
We triangulated the country case studies with other evidence so we could
generalize some of the findings to the entire portfolio. Our findings on scope
and scale and on mobilization of third-party capital (chapter 2) are based
primarily on ex post data, whereas the findings on the expected alignment

     The multivariate L1 statistic measures the multidimensional distance between two samples,
and it can assume a value ranging between 0 (meaning the two samples are perfectly bal-
anced) and 1 (meaning the two samples are perfectly imbalanced). For illustration, consider a
Private Sector Window (PSW) sample and a non-PSW sample, each containing two projects.
Assume that the PSW sample consists of a solar power project in Nigeria and a microfinance
project in Kenya, whereas the non-PSW sample consists of a microfinance project in Nige-
ria and a solar power project in Kenya. The individual proportions of solar power projects,
of microfinance projects, of Nigerian projects, and of Kenyan projects is the same in each
sample (that is, 0.5). Hence, univariate L1 statistics for sector and country would both be equal
to 0, and the two samples are said to be perfectly balanced on sector and perfectly balanced
on country. But if we take multidimensionality into account (that is, if we consider country
and sector together), there is no project in the PSW sample that has the same combination
of countries and sectors as any project in the non-PSW sample. Hence, the multivariate L1
statistic equals 1, and the PSW and non-PSW samples are said to be perfectly imbalanced on
country and sector.

     The blended finance report noted that the “business case for the development project should
be strong and based on robust market assessment” (World Bank 2020, 12). This resonates with
the findings of this report that financial and nonfinancial additionalities and addressing chal-
lenges to private sector investment in project design are important aspects of the potential
for market development.

ects, which is also discussed in this report) allows IFC and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency to demonstrate that they have addressed
challenges to private sector investment in PSW-eligible countries and have
supported market development and market creation. Scale refers to in-
creasing investment levels in countries in which IFC and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency were already operating, and scope refers to
increasing the range of investments in terms of countries and sectors. The
early assessment looked at these two dimensions and found that the scale
(IFC investment and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency guarantee
volumes in PSW-eligible countries) had not increased significantly after the
introduction of the PSW, but the PSW had allowed the two institutions to
enter new markets and sectors (positive effect on scope).

The early assessment focused on assessing the Bank Group process to define
and approve concessions—that is, which units were involved at which stage.
It found that the process was rigorous and consistent with the minimum
concessionality principle. The early assessment did not, however, evaluate
whether the subsidies had adequately addressed challenges to private sector
investment and whether they distorted markets in client countries.

The early assessment review of the PSW governance structure, which includes
a PSW Oversight Committee and a PSW Secretariat, and of the approval
process of PSW projects was positive overall. It found that the decision-mak-

ing process had not significantly limited the usage of the PSW under IDA18
and had resulted in only a moderate increase in administrative costs ($11.2
million, representing 0.6 percent of total IDA18 PSW volume). However, the
report suggested further monitoring of processing time and costs.

Calculations and Methodological
Issues

This appendix complements the concessionality section of chapter 3 by
providing more information on how the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the
International Development Association (IDA) calculate concessionality and
on the related methodological issues.


The Impact of Higher Sovereign and Corporate
Risks on Default Probabilities and on Pricing
Default probabilities increase significantly with risks. Table D.1 shows the
relationship between Standard & Poor’s default probabilities and credit rat-
ings. Two points stand out: first, default probabilities increase very steeply
as the sovereign and corporate ratings decline, and second, default probabil-
ities increase very quickly at longer tenors in riskier markets.

The ability to move risk from IFC and MIGA to IDA is therefore key for IFC
and MIGA to engage in IDA countries. The mechanics of the IDA Private
Sector Window (PSW) first-loss structure are basically to reduce the loss
given default from, for example, 35 percent to, for example, 2.5 percent.
Continuing the previous example, such risk mitigation brings the risk ad-
justments down from 8 percent to 0.6 percent, from 21 percent to 1.4 per-
cent, and from 29 percent to 2.06 percent. This enables IFC to price at local
market rates.


How Is Concessionality Calculated and
Monitored?
Concessionality is calculated against a market price at a point in time, and
it is reported as such to management and the Board. Every PSW project has
to adhere to a set of eligibility criteria (box D.1), one of which is the min-
imum concessionality principle. Concessionality is calculated against a
market price at a point in time by comparing the market cost of a guarantee
or currency hedge available from a private sector provider with a price IDA
provides to IFC or MIGA to enable them to price their transactions at market.
(Note that when there is no market provider, IFC and MIGA use their risk and
pricing models to estimate what a private sector provider would charge for
this risk mitigation.)

»	 The concessionality is determined by comparing the estimated discounted
                                                                                       Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    83
   cash flows on a market transaction and an IDA transaction, and the differ-
   ence is reported in IFC, MIGA, and IDA documents as the cost of the conces-
   sion.

»	 The estimated cost of the concession is a point-in-time estimate, and invest-
   ment teams can use multiple estimates on multiple types of interventions to
   try to get to the best option with the lowest concessionality. These calcula-
   tions are not always done and are not shown in Board papers.

»	 The ongoing losses on the IDA PSW facilities, if any, are aggregated and re-
   ported by facility. Because IDA PSW concessions are given as price reductions
   on credit risk mitigation agreements (for example, guarantees), and these

 Box D.1. E

  All PSW-supported International Finance Corporation (IFC) or Multilateral Investment
  Guarantee Agency (MIGA) transactions are governed by IFC’s and MIGA’s respective
  policies and procedures. IFC and MIGA accountability and governance mechanisms
  have jurisdiction over all matters and complaints related to those transactions; IDA
  policies and procedures do not apply. This is aligned with existing Bank Group collab-
  oration in that the fiduciary, integrity, and performance standards approved by IFC’s
  and MIGA’s Boards of Directors would apply to transactions under the PSW involving
  IFC or MIGA.

  Our reviews of procedures and approval documentation and our interviews confirmed
  that IFC addresses market pricing and concessionality issues in its investment review
  process on each IDA PSW transaction and that IFC pricing was not below market. The
  projects included pricing comparators in their documentation, and this was reviewed
  and approved by IFC management, the IFC credit officer, the Blended Finance Com-
  mittee, and IDA. The concessionality calculations were standardized, documented,
  and also approved by IFC’s Blended Finance Committee and IDA at the point in time
  when the investment was approved. However, all interviewees involved in this process
  agreed that these calculations did not give any insight into the actual costs that might
  be incurred by IDA.

Each IDA PSW product has a standardized but different way of calculating
the estimated concessionality. Table D.2 shows the IDA PSW average esti-
mated concessionality by facility. In addition, we provide an explanation of
how the concessionality is estimated for each instrument.

   down to where they can price transactions that will be acceptable to local
   market clients. The concession is calculated by comparing the market price
   of an FLG to the price IDA provided to enable IFC or MIGA to price at market,
   and then calculating the NPV of both estimated cash flows over the life of the
   client facility and calculating the difference in NPVs between IDA’s guarantee
   price and the market price. This is a point-in-time calculation. The actual
   cost to IDA of providing the risk mitigation will fluctuate with the market and
   changes in risks. IFC prepares quarterly loss given default reports for each
   client, and the results feed into the IFC loss-provisioning system. There is no
   transaction-by-transaction reporting and no adjustments to the FLGs based
   on these data. The Board does not see reports that track how losses are mate-
   rializing against expectations.

»	 Pooled first-loss guarantees (PFLGs) are estimated based on the expected
   loss of an estimated model portfolio of assumed transactions with different
   sizes and different risk ratings at the time the pool or platform is approved.
   The model portfolio is expected to reflect the actual portfolio generated by
   IFC and guaranteed by PSW. The concession is calculated by comparing the
   market price of a commercial PFLG on this estimated model portfolio with
   the IDA PSW price for the PFLG and calculating the NPV differences over
   the life of the estimated pool. The actual cost of the PFLG to IDA changes
   as transactions are brought into the pool and as market conditions change.
   These changes are not reflected in changing cost estimates at the pool level.


                                                                                      Independent Evaluation Group World Bank Group    87
   Although IFC prepares a loss given default report each quarter for each client
   facility, these calculations do not feed into the pooled first-loss calculations
   and do not alter the first-loss percentages. The Board does not see the loss
   given default reports or any reporting on the changes in costs to the PSW.

»	 MIGA FLGs and risk-sharing facilities are estimated based on the expected
   loss due to noncommercial risks. This is based on a country’s risk rating and
   default expectations at the point in time the risk insurance is purchased. The
   concession is calculated as the difference between the NPV of a stream of pay-
   ments for a commercial political risk insurance policy and the NPV of the IDA
   PSW first-loss or shared loss coverage over the tenor of the insurance policy.
   MIGA tracks changes in risk ratings and loss reserves (quarterly) and adjusts
   their loss reserves, but these do not lead to adjustments to the IDA PSW loss
   coverage. These adjustments to loss estimations are not reported to the Board.
