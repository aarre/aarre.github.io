A strong entrepreneurial ecosystem is essential for digital revolution. This 
report assesses entrepreneurship ecosystems in Central America and provides 
a series of recommendations. The assessment was carried out in four 
countries of Central America - Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and 
Honduras - and combined a set of analytical instruments. It included an 
analysis of firm-level microdata, an analysis of public programs and 
intermediary organizations to support entrepreneurship, focus groups, and an 
online survey of more than 2,000 firms on technology use. The findings and 
the corresponding recommendations also cover challenges that make it 
difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to digitalize their 
operations and for start-ups in general.
